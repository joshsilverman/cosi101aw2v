Introduction





HealthCorps Mission, Vision and Program Information





VISION


HealthCorps®’ vision is to lead a nationwide movement toward a new generation of healthy young people. We were founded by heart surgeon and three –time Daytime Emmy Award-winning talk show host, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and his wife Lisa, founded the organization to combat the childhood obesity crisis.

The HealthCorps curriculum helps students connect to their friends, family, and communities. We engage them in experiential learning and deploy them to their schools and communities to communicate their learning.





MISSION


HealthCorps provides an innovative, in-school model and curriculum that inspires teens to make healthier choices and encourages their families to do the same.





PROGRAMS


Our Living Labs program and HealthCorps University distribute our curriculum to schools





Living Labs


The Living Labs program embeds a trained HealthCorps Coordinator in a high school, full-time for five days a week during the school year. Coordinators serve as a peer mentor for a minimum of two years and lead nutrition, fitness, and mental resilience activities to

give teens purpose,

help them develop human character

inspire their interest in medical, health, fitness, and culinary arts careers.



The Living Labs program operates in a school for a maximum of four years. Thereafter, the school is offered a HealthCorps University for key staff to ensure sustainability.





HealthCorps University


HealthCorps University is a train-the-trainer, professional development program that makes available to schools and communities nationwide the HealthCorps principles and curriculum. Participants are provided with training, resources, tools, support, and cutting-edge technology to execute in their schools and organizations.



Current research and best practice indicate that evidence-based, train-the-trainer programs are more effective than other approaches in engaging educators. When co-constructed, they adapt models to local context, align with school improvement, use language that resonates with administrators, and specify that the roles of district and school personnel and are concrete, tangible, and adaptable to many settings (Reference 6) 1 . The HCU training model was designed in accordance with this research and best practice, in addition to the valuable insight and knowledge from HealthCorps’ in-school program staff provided.

The most current research on the effectiveness of train-the-trainer programs and follow-up technical assistance and support inform us that schools improve more quickly. They undertake more improvements when follow-up support and coaching is provided (References 1-4). Without them, improvement teams tend to stop working (Reference 5).

In addition to providing in-person training, HealthCorps University offers continuous support services for the proper delivery and assessment of HCU.





HEALTHCORPS ACTIVISM


Even though the curriculum is an integral part of the in-school model, real change occurs because coordinators impart activism through their programming. Activism differs for each HealthCorps’ community.

Every coordinator holds a school-wide health fair infused with student commitment to educate and activate their communities through booth engagement. For example, Café O-Yeas occur in school cafeterias and bring classroom messaging to the table where students share meals. Furthermore, youth-led programs, such as Youth-Led Action Research (YLAR) allow students to interact with their community to solve wellness-related issues they deem important. Community events, like Highway to Health Festivals, provide students with opportunities to serve and lead their communities towards better wellness by showcasing easy ways to make life changes.

These examples represent only a few of the ways HealthCorps coordinators bring their classroom messaging to the school and surrounding community to activate healthy change.

For more information about HealthCorps youth programs, please see the Activism section.

HealthCorps Curriculum History and Description




In 2003, the blueprint for the HealthCorps program was implemented as a 10-month pilot. Heart surgeon, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and his wife, Lisa, set out to follow the guidelines of “Healthy People 2010,” a federal government initiative from the Department of Health and Human Services to advance a nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda that included a program fighting childhood obesity.

HealthCorps launched in 2004 a lunchtime workshop program at George Washington Educational Campus in Washington Heights, New York, minus a written curriculum. HealthCorps operated in partnership with Touro College for training and supervision.

By 2007, HealthCorps embarked on a national rollout, extending its health education and mentoring program to 36 schools, including 29 New York City high schools, 2 in New Jersey, 1 in Florida school, and another in Pennsylvania.

When the first written curriculum was created, it combined lessons created by the original nine coordinators with content from the YOU™ book series created by HealthCorps Chairman Dr. Mehmet Oz and Advisory Board Member Dr. Michael Roizen of the Cleveland Clinic.

This update is the fourth of the HealthCorps curriculum, and the program now operates in 62 schools across 13 states and the District of Columbia. Since our inception, we have directly impacted over 140,000 students.

HealthCorps staff, Board of Directors, advisory members, and coordinators have been vital to curriculum creation and have edited lessons based on their expertise and the practical experiences of our coordinators in the classroom. The curriculum challenges students to triumph over their 100,000-year old metabolism - which still wants to hunt and gather - sophisticated marketing ploys, peer pressure, and their own excuses.

It serves as a personal and societal roadmap for a wellness movement, thereby supporting our mission of empowering people to understand the small, accessible steps they can take to achieve significant change for their families, friends, and communities.

How does HealthCorps improve the health and wellness of youth and change the educational paradigm of schools? This task is challenging because youth are often participating in risky behaviors that threaten their health and wellness, and schools may not offer skills-based comprehensive health education to help their students decrease those behaviors.

The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey that collected data on students from across the country provided these statistics:

15.2% are overweight.

13% are obese.

25.2% watched 3 or more hours of television per day.

10.4% did not participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on any day.

20.1% were bullied on school property.

16.2% have been electronically bullied.

28.5% felt sad and hopeless almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row.

32.8% were in a physical fight one or more times and had to be treated by a nurse or doctor.

38.7% had a drink of alcohol at least one day of the 30 days before the survey.

4.9% had one cigarette at least one day of the 30 days before the survey.

11.9% have been told they have asthma and still have asthma.



These risk factors endanger not only the health of our youth but interfere with their academic performance.

The HealthCorps curriculum units, Healthy Eating, Healthy Body, Mental Resiliency, and Healthier You, reduce risk factors, help youth develop and maintain healthy behaviors that improve academic performance, and provide knowledge and skills to prepare them for life and work in the 21st century.

Each unit relies on the performance indicators of the National Health Education Standards and the Characteristics of Effective Health Education, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the best practices HealthCorps has developed through our in-school programs. Students learn health education content and skills and demonstrate proficiency through authentic assessments. By teaching skills, the curriculum is student-centered and age appropriate and builds personal competence and self-efficacy.

These unique characteristics of the HealthCorps curriculum are the key to improving the health and wellness of youth and changing the health education paradigm of schools from content reliance to skills-based learning.

HealthCorps Activism




HealthCorps Activism addresses the specific needs of the schools and communities we serve and a vehicle through which students impact them. HealthCorps’ activism ensures that the lessons come to life and resonate with the students and their communities. By promoting agency and stewardship through activism, real change occurs.





Assessment


To deliver our activist components to the HealthCorps communities accurately, we employ two important tools for assessing school and community needs. The Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Healthy Schools Program Inventory helps schools articulate what they do or need to improve to encourage physical activity and eating a balanced diet. In accordance with their School Wellness Council, HealthCorps schools complete a program inventory to discover health and wellness needs and then create a plan for change.

In addition to the Inventory, HealthCorps schools utilize a Community Assessment to allow HealthCorps to understand more fully the demographic, social, and cultural makeup of our schools and communities. We help coordinators make evidence-based decisions so that they can tailor the standardized HealthCorps program to serve our communities more effectively.

This tool allows HealthCorps to track environmental changes (food and physical activity resource availability, wellness policies, council statuses, etc.). It demonstrates to HealthCorps’ funders an ability to provide multifaceted evidence of program efficacy as well as data for the specific communities served. (i.e. The California Endowment). HealthCorps created the Community Assessment tool, and several pieces are amended versions provided by the Community Toolbox Website.





Planning, Resources and Action


Once their needs have been ascertained, HealthCorps schools and communities respond with activism.





School and Community Activism


HealthCorps activism occurs in the community and schools and consists of program components that are delivered nationwide. Each is intended to elevate wellness awareness in the school.

HealthCorps activates our schools and communities accordingly:

After School Clubs: provide additional opportunities for students to engage in cooking, exercise, and creativity beyond the classroom.

Café O’Yea: create interactive, creative experiences for students in cafeterias. They focus on activities done monthly, i.e. food sampling, exercise competitions, health trivia etc.

Creating Local Community Partnerships: with local storeowners to increase healthy options in community stores and markets.

Farmer’s Market Stand: green entrepreneurism for food deserts.

Growing Green Gardens: creating and maintaining school and community gardens.

Highway to Health Festival: A wellness festival for all ages to highlight community health resources and engage everyone in reaching the goal of wellness for all citizens.

MLK Day of Service: An event focused on students and staff at school volunteering for the day.

Pedometer Competitions: Staff pedometer competitions are a great way to build healthy competition in schools to remind teachers and staff the importance of walking 10,000 steps a day.

School Health Fairs: A school-wide wellness event where students, staff, and cooperating health resources unite to create awareness and promote overall school and societal wellness.

School Wellness Councils: Working with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, School Wellness Councils are established to work on projects to increase health and wellness on campus. The School Wellness Councils often enlist a variety of members from students, administrators, faculty, and staff.

Staff Wellness: Engaging school staff to improve its own health to role models and wellness advocates in a school. This participation is manifested through wellness challenges, walking competitions, or healthy newsletters.

Teen Battle Chef: The Teen Battle Chef program combines leadership and public speaking skills with experience in cooking various foods to students for practice after school.

YLAR: Students bring school activism to the community by assessing its needs, conducting action research, and making recommendations for improvements.





After School Clubs


Starting an afterschool club gives students and staff a chance to experience HealthCorps after school in a more intimate space where students may flex their muscles, explore new activities, and connect workshops beyond the classroom. An afterschool club also helps teenagers remain playful, which is a critical in a adolescent’s overall health and cognitive development. High quality programming and consistent participation from students and staff result when sensitivity for their needs and interests shows

Due to nation-wide budget cuts, after school programming needs new options for student engagement. HealthCorps does so by offering programming that students request. Coaching sports teams, joining pre-existing after school clubs, running cooking workshops, and introducing new activities facilitated by various wellness experts provide needed after school opportunities. The after-school component is integral to HealthCorps programming because it provides an opportunity to mentor students and develop strong relationships with them outside the classroom.

Frequently Asked Questions

What after school clubs have been successful?

Yoga: HealthCorps partners with Yoga Across America for access to licensed yoga instructors.

Meditation: The benefit of all mediation is scientifically established. HealthCorps partners with Sahaja meditation, whose practitioners conduct meditation instruction for free at the request of our high schools.

Martial Arts: Capoeira, Tae Kwon Do

Walking or Running groups

Dance

Cooking

Service: HealthCorps high school students interested in service adopt a community center or middle school and volunteer once a week to bring their HealthCorps workshops to others.

Café O’Yea


The school cafeteria is traditionally the focal point of a student’s lunch routine. Café O’Yea introduces students to new and healthier food options, competitions, and hands on activities during lunch. Additionally, it gives HealthCorps another opportunity to interact with new students, invite them to participate in afterschool programs, test booth ideas for the health fair, and build relationships with cafeteria and custodial staff.

As a laboratory for exploration, Café O’Yea workshops include food lessons, demonstrations, experiments, taste tests, and games that take place in the school’s cafeteria or wherever students dine.

Toolkit

Table set up monthly

Associated materials with the demonstration at hand



Frequently Asked Questions

How do I receive approval to teach in an unconventional school space?

Depending on your school, you will need approval from the Principal or the cafeteria or janitorial staffs. It is critical that you present staff and supervisors with the programming plans and receive permission.

When should I schedule my Café O’Yea?

Choose a day that works best with your teaching schedule. Preparation, visuals, and smart placement are keys to success. Delivery of Café O’Yea proceeds more quickly when you engage students to handle certain tasks.

How can you make cafeteria programming move beyond simply giving out snacks?

Ideally, Café O’Yea is a learning experience, not just a food sampling station. Once you establish yourself, make the students work for the snack through physical activities or answering questions. Ask for ideas about what you might present at the next session. As you come to know your students, ask them to help you run a Café O’Yea. Use the Café O’Yea as an informal opportunity to share important information and build relationships and a HealthCorps presence.





Creating Local Community Partnerships


HealthCorps works with local stores or bodegas to promote the importance of access to healthy foods. Ideally, stores offer items, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grain bread, low-fat milk, low-salt, and no-sugar-added canned goods. The goal is to create demand in the marketplace and show students that healthy options do exist in their neighborhoods. Try partnering with community store owners and organizations to create awareness, raise demand, and provide access to healthy food options near your school or where your students visit regularly.

Food deserts are prevalent in many cities, towns, or rural areas, and access to healthy food options may be limited. Students and families ultimately rely on bodegas and neighborhood stores for their basic food shopping. Many tend to stock conventional convenience goods, little fresh produce, and snack foods devoid of nutritional value.

Toolkit

Neighborhood map

Bodega/corner store/convenient store locations



Keep In Mind

Assemble a team of students, staff, and neighborhood establishments to discuss food access issues impacting them. Create a questionnaire for local grocery store to monitor their snack food options, produce, and beverage choices. Have students arrange an appointment with a retailer to conduct a formal survey.

Meet with your local storeowner to discuss orchestrating a demand for healthier foods in the community. Express your desire to work with the store; start small and explain how you will promote ideas to the community.

Consider hosting cooking demonstrations in or near a local store, using its new items to promote them.





Farmer’s Market Stand


If you have started a school garden, expect a bountiful supply of colorful vegetables in a matter of months, and schools can use this produce in their salad bars. HealthCorps cooking classes welcome the ingredients for their sessions, and they make perfect samples for Café O’Yea’s. To connect with the neighborhood, schools can inquire about setting up a stand at a local farmers’ market . Implementing a program beyond its walls creates project and mission awareness and showcases the school’s offerings.

Farmers’ markets are popular and found in most urban and rural areas. Since some house several markets, try to identify the most relevant. Most markets offer vendor space for a fee, but ask for a waiver as a gesture of good will. Be sure to emphasize that you are not selling for profit and the revenue will be returned to the school garden project account.

Toolkit:

Any certifications to sell food

Frequently Asked Questions:

How will you preserve the produce harvested at the beginning of the week?

If your affiliated farmers market is on Saturday and you harvest Monday, make sure that you have enough refrigerator or freezer space to keep your produce fresh during the week.

What else can your students share with the community other than produce?

Your stand can be a platform for Teen Battle Chef demonstrations, sharing health tips, upbeat music, or any original outlet that showcases health activism.





Growing Green Gardens


Gardening allows students to see how their food is grown and provides an opportunity to make connections with food they eat every day. When learning how to grow their own food, students eventually realize the value in fresh produce and take a personal stake in its growth. Although growing food is something at which everyone may be successful, it requires some mental resilience, and students soon learn that their hard work will yield fresh foods for themselves and their families and neighborhoods.

In places where residents have limited access to fresh food, gardening shows individuals that they can produce nutritious local produce. Gardening projects encourage citizens and students to own their food system and make the case for fresh foods availablity to all Americans.

Toolkit

Will vary depending on design; some basics are:

Lumber: For raised beds

Landscaping fabric: to line the bottom of your new beds and control weeds.

Soil: Look for free or inexpensive compost and topsoil.

Seeds: You can purchase your own or even find free seed programs.

Shovels: A few digging shovels are necessary for turning the earth.

Hoes: The most organic method of weed control.

Hose: To water your plants.

Gloves: Not necessary but handy to have for the first time gardeners.

Wheelbarrow



Keep In Mind

The design of your garden will fit the space allotted by the school or municipality. In a school with limited space, raised beds are ideal for creating gardens. Based on the length of the raised beds, students can construct as many as twenty or a single bed. A standard raised bed size is 4 by 8 feet

Pedometer Competition


Fitness is a hallmark of a healthy individual. Regular physical activity has been credited with higher academic scores and improved emotional health. Competition challenges youth to strive for goals and improve their performance, whether in athletics, the classroom, or an after school job. Although exercise may seem daunting to many students unaccustomed to regular physical activity, walking is a relatively easy exercise that promotes an active lifestyle, gives walkers an opportunity to socialize, and may take place at almost any time and place.

Walking relieves stress, boosts moods, lowers blood pressure, and may extend one’s life by two minutes for every minute walked. Measuring steps with a pedometer helps track daily movement. HealthCorps encourages students to walk at least 10,000 steps a day, which translates to approximately 3.5 miles. Making and maintaining small, healthy changes are possible, one-step at a time.

Prizes for winners



Frequently Asked Questions

How will I motivate students or staff to become excited about the pedometer competition?

People like to compete for prizes, but even more so, they like to be a part of something fun and engaging. Try choosing a theme and create excitement so that participants eagerly anticipate the event. Consider the time of year when running the competition and take advantage of school events, like homecoming. Encourage students and staff to spread the word via announcements, students dressed in costumes, or special booths to announce the event.

How long do I run my competition?

Be clear about the competition parameters and expectations. Three weeks is ideal. Ensure the guidelines are clear and establish a weekly timeframe for collecting tracking sheets or logging weekly steps.

School Health Fairs


Every year, school health fairs expose students and staff to resources found within or outside the campus. By bringing in new experiences and exhibitors, HealthCorps introduces students to practical tools, products, and lifestyle elements and engages them. Health fairs rely on the interest of students and are driven by findings from the Community Assessment tool.

Students may hear the words, health fair, and think of boring brochures, blood pressure testing, and foods that taste like wood. HealthCorps creates an engaging experience that makes a healthy lifestyle appealing to students. Ideally, students lead health fair booths for other students. This peer-to-peer education engaging them and has relevance.

Toolkit

Event space and budget

Health fair planning and support team

Tables to serve as booths

Materials for the event

A stage or staging area for entertainment



Critical Steps in Planning

Decide when and where it will be held. Determine which space works for the event and obtain approval from school staff. Set your event budget and make it a priority to engage as many healthy services and booth materials as you can, free of charge. This event provides an opportunity to introduce health resources to your staff and students.

When choosing a theme for your health fair, ask students what they think would engage them or others. Their input may be insightful. Work with your wellness council to make this decision because it will build commitment to the event.

Target vendors and student groups to contact.

Promote your health fair through creative advertising. Work with student groups to maximize your outreach—students can spread the word and build interest in the event.

As the date of the health fair approaches, purchase or obtain all the supplies, prizes, and equipment you may need.

Assemble your event team. Pick students and teachers to set up, manage, and tear down the event. Be clear about the team’s responsibilities.

On the day of the event, allow substantial time for set up and tear down.

After the event, write thank you notes to everyone who helped.





School Wellness Council


The Wellness Council provides the school’s key players with health promotions at your school. Its members also provide guidance, support, and solutions to the Wellness Council. School members also know the best person to ask questions regarding school or neighborhood partnerships.

Needed before the meeting

Identify the key players in health and wellness at your school and contact them.

Ask your teacher mentor or Assistant Principal who should be on your wellness council.

Send an email or ask what times or dates are best to schedule a monthly meeting? Before school, after school, during lunch? A Google doc or Doodle may serve as helpful technological devices.

Make sure your meeting is routinely scheduled. Example: Third Thursday of the month before school from 6:45 - 7:45 A.M..

Secure a conference room or classroom that where you can regularly hold your meetings.

Add these wellness council meetings to the school calendar so administrators and others are aware of them.

Always provide snacks or a meal, depending on your budget.



Organizing and maintaining successful Wellness Council:

Lead! By using consistent messaging and leading by example, demonstrate that health is a priority for this council. Start with the well-being of members in your organization and work outwards as the year progresses to achieve a ripple effect. A week before every meeting, send an agenda, announce that a snack or meal will be served, and indicate the time and place.

CC the Principal to let him or her know you are holding this meeting.

Create an agenda to email and have handouts at the meeting. This agenda should have fill in the blanks for people to volunteer for tasks the committee wants assume.

In the agenda, announce what special activities are scheduled for the month. Highlight a few things underway or a few coming up. Do not give them a laundry list of everything you have been doing at your school.

Example: “I have been working with the student council on their Relay for Life walk. We will begin meditation in the teacher’s lounge starting next Friday during lunch each week. Teen Battle Chef begins February 2nd, if you’d like to be a judge one week please let me know.”

After the Alliance Inventory has been completed, work with your Wellness Council to determine a category of the inventory they feel most passionate about. Look for the items on the inventory that need work and the low hanging fruit. Consider items that interest your Wellness Council and are easy to change or present a vision of other changes that would contribute to a healthier school.

If someone is unable to attend the meeting, contact him or her by email that includes the meeting notes or discuss what you covered.





Organize! Identify health ambassadors in your school and neighborhoods, including staff and students. It is important to involve students and give them a voice. Do not do all the work yourself; rather, facilitate. Encourage these leaders and empower them to take the initiative because they are trusted messengers and instrumental in communicating the importance of being healthy of heart, mind, and body.

Take Action! Develop an action plan and be committed to following through with tasks and projects. Prioritize what is most feasible for your council and determine what will raise wellness.

Food! Always, always, always provide a nutritional incentive for attending meetings. It is also a nice way to show your appreciation for their valuable donated time.

Recognize! Show your appreciation for your Wellness Council. Thank you emails, muffins, or signs around school identifying your Wellness Council members help them feel supported and appreciated.



Completing the Alliance for a Healthier Generation Inventory:

Contact. At the beginning of the school year contact your Alliance representative, because each school does or will have one. He or she is invaluable resource to launch your program successfully. Visit www.healthiergeneration.org

Inventory. This instrument is found on the website and can be printed or completed electronically. You will not have many of these answers, especially in your first year. Break it down using the sections and distribute the responses to the members of your council who are versed in the subject. Refer to the printed version of the inventory for which person to ask.

Submit. Once completed, submit the inventory to the Alliance. Thereafter, an Action Plan can be formulated based on your specific needs, as evidenced by the inventory.



Receiving recognition for your school from the Alliance:

To apply for the National Recognition Award, schools must complete and submit the application with supporting documentation that demonstrates that the school is implementing the best practices outlined in the Healthy Schools Program Framework.

All schools applying for the National Recognition Award should follow these steps:

Complete the online Healthy Schools Program Inventory.

Upon completion of the inventory, schools receive a detailed report that shows current award status and action steps they need to complete in order to be eligible for an award.

If it meets a level of recognition (Bronze, Silver or Gold), the school will be notified that it is eligible to apply for a National Recognition Award and directed to the online application.

Schools should submit their supporting documentation and complete the application according to the instructions contained therein.

A National Recognition Manager will work with Alliance staff and the applicant to assess compliance with the award criteria.



Please note: The Alliance may conduct site visits on occasion to review a school’s application for recognition.

In preparation for the award application, schools are encouraged to utilize Healthy Schools Program Toolkits for all content area and take special notice of the evidence of success outlined for each criteria. These documents are required to complete the application, and we encourage you to start as early as possible.





Staff Wellness


Attention to the health of school teachers and staff is essential to the overall well being of a school campus. By investing in their health, HealthCorps creates a foundation for healthy living in schools and provides support to the individuals most responsible for a thriving society. Below, examples of staff events that spread the HealthCorps message follow.

Exercise Revolution, the Course

Dr. John Ratey has created a course for staff members who are interested in bringing a new type of physical education to their schools. http://johnratey.typepad.com/blog/spark-the-course.html

Teacher Appreciation Day

Invite local wellness vendors to offer special, complimentary or discounted treatments to teachers and school staff.

Lunch and Learns

During lunch, hold for staff members, as an element of their professional development, workshops led by guest speakers and include information they want to know more about, such as diabetes, weight loss, healthy cooking, etc.

Staff Wellness Competitions

Organize a weight loss plan for teachers that includes regular weigh in’s, pedometer use, fitness workouts, and special prizes for winners at the conclusion of the competition.





Teen Battle Chefs


Food is a culture, nature, and camaraderie. We can foster a healthy relationship with food by teaching students of its origins, varieties, flavors, and ability to bring people together. This promotion is done through a partnership with Teen Battle Chef (TBC), which was developed by Lynn Fredericks, the founder of Family Cook Productions.

Teen Battle Chef is a pathway for students to experience cooking, bond with other students, and cultivate leadership skills. In TBC, a limited number of students are offered internships with local restaurants and chefs. Students understand the value of food’s evolution and the journey from farm to table.

Cooking is the strongest, easiest, and most accessible way to connect students with food. In the afterschool cooking class, the alchemy and mystery of the kitchen is demystified. HealthCorps provides students with essential skills to create meals, master the use of knives, and cook for themselves and their friends and families.

Frequently Asked Questions

How do we promote healthy relationships with food?

Make it a point to sit down and eat together with students. Have them share something for which they are thankful in their lives. Discuss the importance of fueling the body with healthy fresh foods and the power of the food mood connection. Ask students to bring in recipes from home and discuss their ingredients and what makes them tasty. Help students understand whether or not the food incorporates healthful elements and how it could be even healthier. Encourage students to share their new skills.

Snowball

Student Scenario: Anger Between Friends

What is Anger?

Help Jack and Kevin!

Review and Exit



Key Terms

Anger: an emotion characterized by antagonism toward something or someone you feel has deliberately done you wrong. (American Psychological Association, 2013)

Communication: a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a commonsystem of symbols, signs, or behavior (Merriam-Webster, n.d.)



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Snowball

The students sit in circle.

Each student receives 2 pieces of different colored construction paper.

Facilitator will read an incomplete sentence: When someone disagrees with me, I tend to...





Student writes one or two word response on a piece of construction paper. When finished they crumple the sheet of paper into a ball and toss it into center of circle.

When done, each student grabs any single snowball (hopefully not his or her own), and reads the response aloud.

Do this process again, only with coordinator saying the following sentence prompt: When I experience someone exhibiting anger (towards me or someone I know), I feel...





2. Student Scenario: Anger Between Friends

Either read this scenario to the class, ask for a volunteer, or have students read in groups and complete the worksheet. Everyone completes the worksheet. All of a sudden, there was a fight in the hallway by Jack’s locker. Kevin was pulling Jack’s books out and throwing them on the floor. Jack was pulling Kevin away from his locker, and both were yelling at each other. Mrs. Jackson stopped the fight and sent the boys to the Dean’s office. After they cooled off, the Dean spoke to each boy separately. It seems that Kevin and Jack are friends, and Kevin let Jack borrow his favorite CD a month ago and wanted it returned. Having lost the CD, Jack made excuses for its whereabouts and finally told Kevin it was in his locker. Kevin grew tired of waiting and went into Jack’s locker to get the CD. Kevin knew it was wrong to do so but did because he was frustrated and angry.





Give the following directions: On your worksheet, Anger Between Friends: Kevin and Jack, compare the benefits of and barriers to resolving their conflict in a healthy way.





Share answers and create a class list.

After comparing the benefits of and barriers to responses, ask the students to identify a solution that benefits the boys.



3. What Is Anger?

Ask the students to define what they think anger is. Have students write their responses on the board.

Explain that anger is an emotion that may be demonstrated positively or negatively. If you are angry about an injustice and work to remedy the problem, you are dealing with anger in a healthy, positive way. If you lose control and verbally or physically assault someone else or his or her property, you are resolving the problem in a negative, unhealthy manner.

Ask students to pair up and come up with three ways to manage anger.

Share. Some answers may be: Recognize that you are angry and try to relax.

Redirect your energy by working out, bike riding, or playing music.

For a different perspective, talk to a trusted friend or adult. (Bronson, 2009, p. 82)





4. Help Jack and Kevin!

With a partner and using a blank piece of paper, students record one common cause of conflict among teens. Students bring their papers to the front of the room and tape them on the board.

In pairs, use the Conflict Resolution Worksheet to resolve the conflict between Kevin and Jack. Remain calm.

Set a positive tone.

Define the conflict.

Take responsibility for personal actions.

Listen to the needs and feelings of others.

List and evaluate possible solutions.

Agree on a solution. (Meeks, Heit, & Page, 2011, p. 59)





In pairs, one student plays the part of Kevin and the other, Jack. Note that, after talking to the Dean, each boy has calmed down and is ready to resolve the conflict. Role play how you planned to resolve the conflict peacefully.





Select one of the common teen conflicts on the board and work through the conflict resolution steps by taking roles and practicing the skill on the Teen Conflict Resolution worksheet.



5. Review

What are several ways to handle anger in a healthy manner?

What are the 6 steps of conflict resolution?

What typical teenage conflicts arise? How can we deal with them in a healthy way?

Social Wellness : A perception of having support available from family, friends, or coworkers in times of need and a perception of being a valued support provider.

Wellness: the quality or state of being healthy.



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Do Now

Ask students to answer the following: What three things do you find most challenging in life? Why are they challenging? What have you learned from these three things?

Share answers with the class.

Ask students if they know what challenges are. Point to the key terms definition, and explain the following. Most people think about a challenge as something negative. By moving away from a negative connotation, such as bad, and towards a positive opportunity, you can experience personal growth. Once you realize life is a series of challenges that you have to navigate, you can approach each and tackle them. Sometimes challenges are too great to handle on your own, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.





2. The Relationship Between Challenges and YOUR Wellness

Place the following graphic on the board, and pass out the corresponding worksheet.

Ask for volunteers to read the following definitions to the class: Emotional Wellness: Possession of a secure self-identity and positive sense of self-regard; also the ability to cope with and/or improve unpleasant moods or states.

Intellectual Wellness: Perception of being internally energized by an optimal amount of intellectual stimulating activity.

Physical Wellness: A perception and expectation of physical health.

Social Wellness: A perception of having support available from family, friends, or coworkers in times of need and a perception of being a valued support provider.





In groups, students will be required to read the following prompt create their own definition of each wellness aspect, and identify how the different aspects of wellness are affected. They will write their answers on the worksheet, and discuss them as a group: Shauna and a group of friends studied together for an important, and all felt prepared. When the scores came back, Shauna was the only one of the group to do poorly on the exam. She stormed out of the class when it was over, and walked away from her friends, not acknowledging their calls after her. Instead of going to soccer practice after school, Shauna went to Burger King and got a double whopper with extra cheese, 2 large fries, and a large soda. She ate the whole thing alone, and stared out the window thinking how mad she was at herself for bombing the test. When she got home, she kicked her backpack into her closet, closed the door, and proceeded to play computer games for 3 hours. Whenever someone messaged her to chat, she clicked the “x” and ignored their comments.





3. Beach Ball/Balloon Activity

In this activity, students are being progressively challenged to keep beach ball/balloon in the air as a group. The activity begins with the assigned group leader’s throwing one beach ball/balloon in the air and allowing students to keep there for one or two minutes. After a minute or two, a second beach ball/balloon is added. Again, allow one or two minutes of play. Add a third and fourth beach ball/balloon over the course of several minutes. The final level of this challenge is for the group to maintain all four balls/balloons in the air while working as a team and not letting any balls fall to the floor.

Explain that something that is perceived as difficult or challenging can actually be rewarding; if we meet that challenge because it allows us to grow and understand ourselves more fully.



4. Role Playing

Ask students to break into small groups and role-play the following scenarios—how would they overcome these challenges? You were throwing a huge birthday bash and intentionally did not invite this one guy. At school, you run into him in the hallway, and he asks you about the party. You feel embarrassed—what do you do?

You and your friend worked together on a school project worth a large part of your grade. You receive the paper from the teacher and discover that your friend received a much better grade than you. You believe it is unfair and feel frustrated. What do you do?

You go to a party and realize from afar that your significant other is talking with someone else and it seems too close for comfort. You feel jealous and angry—what do you do?





5. Challenges In My Life

In this activity, students have the opportunity to take this lesson personally. The facilitator begins by sharing a personal challenge he or she faces and models for students how to think through the questions below. Then, students self-reflect, journal, or draw in response to the following questions: Thinking about your life today, what are some challenges you are facing?

How are you currently handling those challenges? (Are the students facing them? Avoiding them? Giving up?)

How have these challenges affected your wellness? (Focus on the social, emotional, intellectual and physical wellness aspects)

How can you change, once you put effort into overcoming this challenge? How will you have changed / transformed as a result of your hard work?

What are 3 things you can do immediately to help you face and overcome your current challenges?





6. Stop and Review: Exit Ticket

Ask students to answer the following: What is a challenge, and how can it affect you?

How are challenges opportunities for growth?

How can you respond positively when encountering challenges in your life?

Key Terms

Note to the facilitator - The components of fitness are defined at the stations. Explain that aerobic exercise is one way a teen can achieve fitness.

Physical fitness: Having the ability to complete daily tasks and still have energy left over at the end of the day. (Bronson, 2009, p. 839)

Aerobic exercise: rhythmic activities, such as jogging, swimming, bike riding, that use large muscle groups for an extended period, (Bronson, 2009, p. 328)

Cardiorespiratory endurance: the ability of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels to send food and oxygen to the body during physical activity. This component is considered the most important for overall health (Bronson, 2009, p. 324)

Muscular strength: the amount of force your muscles exert. (Bronson, 2009, p. 324)

Muscular endurance: how long your muscles perform physical tasks before tiring. (Bronson, 2009, p. 325)

Flexibility: the body moving through a full range of movement. (Bronson, 2009, p. 325)

Body composition: The different components of the body, such as muscle, bone, fat, water, and minerals. The amount of body fat is of greatest concern. (Hahn, 2011)





On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Do Now: Why Work It Out?

As students enter the classroom, ask them to stand in a large circle. Be sure the desks have been moved to accommodate the group.

Choose one student to start with an exercise move and give him or her a chance to trick the group with fancy footwork. Allow a few students to lead the group in movement.

At the end of the Do Now, ask students how they feel after starting class with movement rather than at their desks. What do they think would happen if they moved between every class?

Split the students into teams.

Ask them to brainstorm a list on how consistent exercise affects one’s body.

Generate a class list.



2. Explore Exercise

Classroom set up – Place the five components of fitness mini-posters around the room. Provide enough space for students to try the different activities.

Divide the class into five groups. Assign one group to each station. A creative way to group the students is to give them the picture that is associated with the station and go to it. Have speakers with music playing while students are working in the stations. Stop the music when it is time to rotate.





Pass out the Explore Exercise! handouts

On the call of the facilitator, students move from station to station. Allow 4 minutes at each station. While there, each completes the worksheet.

Stations: Cardiovascular endurance – When your heart, lungs, and blood vessels are healthy, you exercise without becoming overly tired. Exercise keeps these vital parts of your body healthy. (Bronson, 2009, p. 324) Take your pulse for 10 seconds. Multiply the number by 6 to determine the times your heart beats in 60 seconds. Record it.

Do high knees for 2 minutes. Take your pulse. Multiply the number by 6 to determine the times your heart beats in 60 seconds. Record it. Rest for one minute and take your pulse again. How close is it to your starting heart rate?

Predict two ways that having cardiovascular endurance affects your health status.

Name two physical activities to include in your day that would increase your cardiovascular endurance.

Exercise examples - walking, cycling, dancing, running, distance swimming (Hahn, 2011, p. 78)





Muscular strength – Muscular strength is needed to lift, push, and jump. (Bronson, 2009, p. 324) Do 10 full range push-ups with your hands placed wider than your shoulders and then 10 full range push-ups with your hands placed shoulder width apart. Explain how the muscles in your arms responded to the activity.

How does having muscular strength help you complete your daily activities?

Predict two ways that having muscular strength affects your health status.

Name two physical activities that you can include in your day to increase your muscular strength.

Exercise examples - Resistance training, including free weights and exercise machines. (Hahn, 2011, p. 81)





Muscular endurance – When a person has good muscular endurance, his or she perform physical activities better without tiring quickly. Muscular endurance is related to a person’s muscular strength. If one is increased, so is the other. Erase the board for two minutes. You may switch hands within the two minutes.

Which part of the exercise was muscular strength?

Which part of the exercise was muscular endurance?

How do the two components complement each other?

How does having muscular endurance help you complete your daily activities?

Predict two ways that having muscular endurance affects your health status.

Name two physical activities to include in your day to increase your muscular endurance.

Exercise examples - Walking, lifting, pushing, pulling. (Hahn, 2011, p. 78)





Flexibility – When a person is flexible, it is easy for him or her to move, bend, and stretch. Flexibility increases athletic performance and reduces the risk of muscular strain and injury. (Bronson, 2009, p. 325) Attempt to touch your toes. Did you bend your knees? (If they are flexible, no) Try it again. Does your flexibility increase the more you try? (yes)

Pretend you are putting sun screen on your back? Can you do it?

How does having flexibility help you complete your daily activities?

Predict two ways that being flexible affects your health.

Name two physical activities that you can include in your day that would increase your flexibility.

Exercise examples - Stretching. (Hahn, 2011, p. 83)





Body composition – When body composition is low, there is less fat compared to lean tissue. Having low body fat helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other weight related illnesses. (Show pictures of a teen with high body fat and one who is lean) How does having low body fat composition help you complete your daily activities?

Predict two ways that having low body fat composition affects your health.

Name two physical activities that you can include in your day to decrease your body fat.

Exercise examples - Exercises that increase muscle and decrease body fat. Aerobic exercises are good to expend a large number of calories. (Hahn, 2011, p. 83)





3. Stop and Review: Which Is It?

Have students stay in their groups.

Describe each station without saying its name. The groups need to answer correctly, “Which is it?” and give an example of that exercise.

On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Work Out What?

Classroom set up – Place around the room the five components of fitness.

Ask the students to remind you what they learned in the last class.

Have one or two students demonstrate or lead a different exercise for each component. Ideally, it should be different students for each component, and they model and then lead the class once.

Ask to identify whether it’s aerobic or anaerobic exercise.

Explain that today they are going to apply what they learned from the last lesson and design a personal fitness plan.



2. Target Your Heart

Note to the facilitator : Explain that target heart rate is usually explained as part of cardiovascular endurance and aerobic exercise. It is the rate of intensity of a workout as determined by the number of times the heart beats.

Target heart rate Resting heart rate for a teen is between 60-100 beats per minute.

Have the students do the following: Take your pulse for 10 seconds. Multiply that number by 6 to find your beats per minute. (Bronson, 2009, p. 336)

Target heart rate is the beats per minute to achieve during aerobic activity. Calculate your target heart rate for a moderately intense workout.

Multiply your age by .7

Subtract that number from 208 to get an estimated target heart rate.

For a moderately intense workout, multiply your maximum heart rate by 70% to determine the number of beats per minute your heart should be beating.

For a low intensity workout, multiply by 50% and for an intense workout, multiply by 85%.





3. Anywhere, Anytime: Plan Workouts for Different Locations

Think of your day at home and school. With a partner(s), brainstorm the exercise that you perform without thinking of it and write it on newsprint. List the component of fitness the exercise best represents Examples may include – walking, lifting (backpacks, groceries, younger siblings), climbing stairs, yard work, walking the dog.





Share with the class.

Split the students into groups. Then plan a workout at one of the following places (home, a park, a gym, school grounds) with exercises that you perform without major equipment and write the plan on flip chart paper. Note the component of fitness the exercise best represents.

Have the group share its plans with the class once completed. Note to facilitator : As the students are working on their fitness plans, invite them to the target and place a check mark that best reflects your understanding of the project, “I’ve got it!” “I am getting there!” “I am lost!”

Do Now: Mad Minute

Macronutrients in the Digestive Highway

Macronutrient Showdown

Brainstorm Best Snacks

Stop and Review: Exit Ticket



Key Terms

Macronutrients: Nutrients that provide your body with energy. The three macronutrients are carbohydrates, protein, and fat. We need them in large amounts. Macro means large.

Carbohydrate: THE GO NUTRIENT. Simple and complex sugars that give your body energy to move, digest your food, and keep your organs working. Your body needs more carbohydrates than any other macronutrient.

Protein: THE GROW NUTRIENT: Chains of amino acids that provide your body with the structures to grow and heal. Protein helps your hair, nails, skin, and muscles grow and fight infections by keeping your immune system strong.


Fat: THE CARGO NUTRIENT: A greasy or oily substance found in animals and plants. Fat helps produce hormones, like estrogen and testosterone. It allows your body to absorb Vitamins A, D, E, and K. It can be stored in your body for later use (i.e., survival on a deserted island, skipping breakfast), and gives our food flavor. Fat also provides cushion for your organs.

Calorie: A unit of energy that comes from the food we eat and drink. Calories give your body energy like gasoline does to a car. How many calories a person needs depends on his or her age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. Our body receives calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

Calories in Macronutrients: 1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 calories; 1 gram of protein = 4 calories; 1 gram of fat = 9 calories.


Best Sources of Carbohydrates: vegetables, fruit, whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat breads/tortillas/pasta, oatmeal), beans.

Best Sources of Protein: beans, nuts, whole grains, fish, lean meats, yogurt.

Best Sources of Fat: fish and its oils, lean meats, nuts, plant oils.



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go…



1. DO NOW:

Mad Minute: With a partner, students create a list of as many foods and drinks they can think of, that contain carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Give the students 1 minute for each macronutrient. The pairs then count how many they have listed for each category.

Ask the students: How do you determine what macronutrients a food is made up of? Answer: The Nutrition Label!

Discussion: Why do we need to know what macronutrients are? See key terms.

What are the best versions of each macronutrient? See key terms.





2. Macronutrients in the Digestive Highway:

Pass out crackers to class: Ask students to take an assessment of the cracker. What does it look, smell, and taste like? Ask them to chew it 50 times and notice to how the taste of the cracker changes.

Demonstration for the Digestive Highway Step 1: Add the soda, crackers, banana, peanut butter, butter, and oil to the ziplock bag using the appropriate color food dye. Break-up food into a Ziploc bag (chewing), pour water into bag (saliva), and half a banana (digestive enzyme). Ask: What macronutrient is breaking down the fastest? Is it a good or bad thing? Do you think we want our food to go through our body quickly, slowly, or super slow?





Step 2: Close the bag making sure there is no air left inside (air would represent gas).

Step 3: Cut a slit in the corner of the bag. Pour contents into stocking, making sure stocking is hanging over the newspaper or trashcan since it will leak (small intestine-liquid pouring out is nutrients being absorbed into the body). Review with the class: What do carbohydrates do for our body? What do proteins do for our body? What do fats do for our body? (Have student helper write the responses on the board under carbs, protein, fat signs).





Step 4: Cut slit at the end of the stocking. Pour into cup (large intestine).

Step 5: Poke a hole through the bottom of the cup and push contents out (waste).

Step 6: With students, discuss and reflect on digestion; use a diagram of the digestive tract. Use rope to illustrate the length of the small intestine.





3. Macronutrient SHOWDOWN!

Each student or team will have a green, yellow, and red card. GREEN represents CARBS, YELLOW represents PROTEIN, RED represents FAT. Create a list of foods to test the students’ knowledge of macronutrients. The representative from the team that shows the correct colored card/cards first receives a point. Review the rules of the game before playing.

Macronutrient SHOWDOWN questions:





Carbohydrates I can be broken down into simple and complex.

My body uses them to make glucose which is fuel for your cells.

I keep your intestines healthy and help with the body’s waste removal. I am your body’s preferred source of energy.

When eaten I am undigested. I can also keep blood sugar down. I contain many B vitamins, and I am helpful for the heart. I am better if I come as a whole, not just a part.

Many people classify me as good or bad, simple or complex. I am the macronutrient your body needs the most.

After a workout, I am needed to replace the energy burned. Processed MNs of this type are not good for you, but whole ones are.

Your brain uses these nutrients to think. Brown rice is a healthy source of this nutrient.

This MN keeps your organs working. This is the GO nutrient - it helps your body move.

Pears and broccoli, like all fruits and veggies, are a healthy source of this nutrient. Cookies and cakes are an unhealthy source of this nutrient.

Your body needs more of this MN than any other. Sugar is a refined type of this MN.



Proteins I am found throughout the body—in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue.

Vegetarians are at a greater risk of not getting enough of me.

I can be found in animal and protein sources. After a workout, I am needed to help repair the muscle tissues.

It requires the body more energy to digest me. Without this MN, you would have no hair!

This MN helps to keep your immune system strong. Beans are a good source of this MN.

This nutrient is the GROW. Your skin, hair, and nails need this MN to grow.

The average high school student needs about 75 grams per day of this MN. Contrary to popular belief, this MN is not ONLY found in meat.

This MN helps to heal your body. Chicken and turkey are a good source of this MN.

Your muscles grow with the intake of this MN. Eating enough of this nutrient will help keep you from getting sick.

Peanut butter is a good source of this MN. Chicken is a good source of this MN.



Fat I am the starting point to make estrogen, testosterone, vitamin D, and other vital compounds.

I absorb vitamins that you get from the food you eat.

I help protect the walls of your cells. This MN cushions your organs.

This MN does not necessarily make you fat. This nutrient is the CARGO.

Olive oil is a healthy example of this MN. This MN helps to produce hormones (testosterone, estrogen).

This MN allows your body to absorb Vitamins A, D, E and K. Walnuts, salmon, and avocado are healthy sources of this MN.

Omega 3 Fatty Acids “Omega 3s” are an antioxidant made from this MN and will help your skin and hair look better. There are three types of this MN: trans, saturated (unhealthy—primarily from animals) and unsaturated (healthy—primarily from plants).



The average high school student needs about 65 grams of this MN per day.

4. Brainstorm Best Snacks

Create a list based on what students have viewed as different macronutrients. Look for things that are cheap and easy to access.

STOP and REVIEW: Exit Ticket



Key Terms

Nutrition: The provision of food to cells and an organism that is necessary to support life.

Serving Size: Listed in standard measurements, such as cups or pieces. This amount is included on the label to help you calculate calories and nutrients.

Calories: A unit of energy; the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. We need calories for everything: moving, breathing, sleeping—without them our bodies would have no energy.

Fat: The unhealthy kind includes saturated and trans; on the nutrition label, healthy fats are listed as unsaturated fat.

Sodium: Commonly called salt, it is vital for healthy nerves and muscles, but most of us get too much in our diet, often from processed foods.

Sugar: Often seen in many forms like honey, maple, high fructose corn syrup, and white or refined grain. Too much can lead to health problems in later life.

Fiber: Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds contain this; fiber helps fill you up or go to the bathroom regularly.

Vitamins/Minerals: They come from plants and animals and are important to boosting our immune system. Examples include potassium, calcium, and A, C, D, E, K and B.

Daily Value: This indicator shows the percentage of a certain nutrient in a food, based on a 2,000-calorie diet. The daily value gives you an idea of a food's nutrient contribution to your diet; 5% or less may be considered low for a particular nutrient, 10% to 19% is good, and 20% or more is high.

Cholesterol: Vital for building hormones and cell membranes. Your body makes most of the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is listed under the fat information on a nutrition label. Most people should consume fewer than 300 mg of cholesterol daily

Hydrogenate d: term that describes food produced by hydrogenation, a process that turns a liquid fat, such as vegetable oil into a semi-solid, more shelf-stable fat, such as margarine. Most oils are only partially hydrogenated, which creates harmful trans fats that can raise cholesterol.



On Your Mark, Ready, Set, Go...



1. DO NOW

While students are working on their Do Now, walk around and hand out cards 1a-8b for the Decoding the Nutrition Label in Activity #2.

Whole class instruction: Write on the board and in the Do Now box on the worksheet:



If you were blindfolded and asked to eat something, would you do it?

What does the word, nutrition, mean to you?



2. Introduction

Explain that even if we bought a lottery ticket every day for the rest of our lives, we still have no control over whether or not our number is chosen in the Powerball draw, We have no control over some things in our lives. Our HEALTH is not one of those things! YOU have the power to be healthy. Forming healthy habits today helps us maintain those habits as adults.

Ask students: What does nutrition mean to you? Define nutrition on the board. Have students copy the definition onto worksheets.

*Nutrition: the provision of food to cells and an organism that are necessary, to support life

Certain foods give the body better quality energy and nutrients than others. Q: How can we know which foods will give our bodies the best fuel? A: By reading the nutrition label!

Say: Would you buy shoes without looking at the size first? Well, why do we buy food without looking at the nutrition label first?





Ask a student to read the YOU will learn on the board.



3. Why Do Foods Have Labels?

Hold up a piece of fruit and a label from a fruit-flavored food item, for example: a strawberry and strawberry ice cream, an apple and Apple Jacks cereal, a blueberry and blueberry Pop Tart, a tomato and ketchup, etc. Adaptations to Activity #1: Print a picture of a piece of fruit or other food for budget/planning sake.





Ask: Why do some foods have labels while others do not? Whole foods, like fruits and veggies, do not need nutritional labels because they are what you see. Other foods have labels for two reasons: 1) they are packaged or 2) they are processed or altered.





4. Decoding the Nutrition Label

Ask: So what does a nutrition label tell us? Activity Prep:

*Create 16 cards/pieces of construction paper (you can also simply print them) labeled 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b to 8b.

*Divide the 16 cards into two packs, one for terms and letters, the other, definitions and numbers. Write one of the following 8 vocabulary words on the a-card and its corresponding definition from the Key Terms section above on a card with the same number and the letter b. Label the cards in the following order. Include a number and letter on each card: 1a: Serving Size

1b: This item is listed in standard measurements, such as cups or pieces. It is included on the label to help you calculate calories and nutrients in the entire package.

2a: Calories

2b: A unit of energy; the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. We need calories for EVERYTHING: moving, breathing, sleeping—without calories our bodies would not have energy!





Really touch on calories with the class, reminding students that calories do not just make you fat but are essential to survival. 3a/3b: Fat/ The unhealthy kinds include saturated and trans, although healthy kinds are also listed on the nutrition label in the form on unsaturated fat.

4a/4b: Sodium/ This item is commonly called salt. It is vital for healthy nerves and muscles, but most of us get too much in our diet, often from processed foods.

5a/5b: Fiber/ Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds contain fiber. It helps fill you up and go to the bathroom regularly.

6a/6b: Sugar/ Comes in many forms like honey, maple, high fructose corn syrup, and white or refined. Too much of it can lead to health problems later in life.

7a/7b: Vitamins/ They come from plants and animals and are important for boosting our immune system. Examples include potassium, calcium, and A, C, D, E, K, and B

8a/8b: Daily Value/ This indicator shows the percentage of a certain nutrient in a food, based on a 2,000-calorie diet. The daily value gives you an idea of a food's nutrient contribution to your diet; 5% or less may be considered low for a particular nutrient, 10% to 19% is good, and 20% or more is high.





Adaptations for Activity #2: For a class that may not have the interest or capacity to read cards aloud: Tape these cards to the white board. Ask for student volunteers to come to the front of the room and reveal their word and then read the definition.





Make sure you pass out these cards while students are completing their Do Now.

Call on students 1a-8b in order and ask them to read aloud their word or definition. As you define the different parts of the nutrition label, point out the areas on the giant laminated label poster and have students match the vocabulary on their worksheets.

Ask the groups to reform and answer the following question: how could reading a nutrition label help prevent or reduce health issues. Share answers out and make a list on the board.



5. Scavenger Hunt

Ask: How many of you have tried reading a nutritional label before? (Show of hands)

Explain: We just went over what the different terms on a N.L. mean, now we are going to practice reading some for ourselves. Once we practice reading nutrition labels, we’ll see that it’s easy and takes no time at all to identify what we are putting into our bodies.

Activity Instructions: Using 8 different snack foods of your choice, set up stations throughout the classroom and have students complete a mini-scavenger hunt to practice reading nutrition labels. Instead of having students read entire labels, ask for certain things at each station to help them practice without feeling overwhelmed.

Stations:

Oreos: Ask students to determine: Serving Size and Fiber.

Kashi 7 Grain Crackers: Ask students to determine: Serving Size and Fiber.

Flaming Hot Cheetos: Ask students to determine: First 5 ingredients and Sodium.

Yogurt: Ask students to determine: First 5 ingredients and Sodium.

Apple: Ask students to determine: Calories and Sugar.

Pop Tarts: Ask students to determine: Calories and Sugar.

Avocado: Ask students to determine: Vitamins and Fat.

Mayonnaise: Ask students to determine: Vitamins and Fat.





6. Feel The Burn

Say:You all just practiced reading nutrition labels, and now we will talk about which of these things our bodies need most. How did you feel about reading labels? Let’s check out six tips that make choosing healthier options much easier. Many food companies make the serving size small so that their product looks healthy. Those items we want to limit (fat, sugar, sodium, calories) don’t seem as unhealthy when they are shown in smaller amounts.

As we go over these tips, let’s keep in mind the effect Serving Size has on how healthy/unhealthy a choice may be.

1. Choose variety. Taste the natural rainbow: Ask students which of those 8 foods are natural in color? Apple, Avocado, Kashi Crackers, Yogurt.





2. Choose whole grain. Compare Oreo to Kashi

Mention the difference between enriched, bleached flour and whole grain





3. Choose fresh. Example: Apple + Avocado Always look at the ingredients!

The ingredient listed first is the ingredient that the food item is mainly made of.

Remember, if you can’t pronounce it, you probably do not want to put it in your body.





4. Choose fiber. Ask students which of the following has more fiber: Kashi crackers or Oreos.

Remind students where we can find fiber.





5. Watch for sugar and salt. What are some health problems that can arise if we consume too much sugar and sodium? Diabetes, High Cholesterol, High Blood Pressure, Heart Attack, Obesity





6. Watch for fat Ask students to discuss which of those snack foods had the most fat.

Mention that there are different types and some are actually healthy fats (unsaturated). However, we are looking only at trans fat and cholesterol. Talk about the healthy fat our bodies need next class.

Define: Cholesterol and Hydrogenated Explain that some fats, like partially hydrogenated oils, aka trans fats, are not natural and cannot be processed by the body. These fats are the most dangerous!





Conclude: Using these 6 tricks, we can make healthier choices just by doing one thing: looking at the nutrition label.





7. S top and Review: Exit Ticket



Pass out an index card and ask the following questions: What is a nutrition label?

How can reading a nutrition label maintain or improve your health?

Exit Ticket: Here’s What? So What? Now What?



Key Terms

Compare: examine the character or qualities to discover similarities or differences. (Merriam Webster, n.d.)

Contrast: show differences when compared (Farlex Incorporated, 2013)

Decision: The act of reaching a conclusion or making up one's mind (Farlex Incorporated, 2013)

Benefit: an advantage. (Farlex Incorporated, 2013)

Barrier: Something immaterial that blocks or impedes the way. (Farlex Incorporated, 2013)

Justify: demonstrate or prove to be just, right, or valid (Farlex Incorporated, 2013)

Evaluate: determine the significance or worth of something. (Merriam Webster, n.d.)



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Sugar Size Up:

Divide students into groups and assign each a different beverage.

Ask students to convert the total sugar in the beverage into teaspoons (4 g = 1 tsp.) and share why it may be important to look at the sugar content of a beverage.

Have the students present their findings to the class and line beverages up in order of most to least sugar.



2. Why Make a Choice?

Ask the students to think about what they drank last night at home. Have them share some ideas. Tell the students that you had 3 Coca-Colas. Using the Why Make A Choice worksheet (downloadable PDF available in Resources tab), ask students to write why you might want to switch from drinking so much soda (under the benefits), and what might be the reasons that you drink that much soda now (under the barriers).

Share these reasons aloud. Create a master list on the board.





Ask the students: Based upon this analysis, do the benefits outweigh the barriers when choosing a non-soda beverage?

Students should say, “Yes.”

Tell students you would like to change your decision process so you drink healthier beverages regularly. Post the Decision Making Chart on the board. Pass out the accompanying worksheet (downloadable PDF available in Resources tab) . As a class, complete the chart. Have students fill it in as a guide.



3. Help Jane and Tom

Give each group one of the beverages: Snapple Juice, Diet Coke, Redbull, and Arizona Iced Tea.

Pass out worksheet: Help Jane and Tom (downloadable PDF available in Resources tab).

Read them the following prompt: Jane and Tom were outside playing HORSE on the basketball court. It was a hot day, and they were running around. Jane and Tom went to the 7-11 afterwards and bought a cold drink (the one at your table). After finishing their drinks, they returned to their game. Five minutes later, Jane and Tom were thirsty again and wanted to another drink. Help Jane and Tom make a healthy decision about which drink to choose.

Once completed, have a spokesperson explain how his or her group reached a decision.



4. Exit Ticket: Here's What? So What? Now What?



In groups, have students complete the Here’s What? So What? Now What? worksheet (downloadable PDF available in Resources tab) . Students write what they learned, why it is important, and how they will apply that kn owledge to something in their lives.

Share out.

Stop and Review: Exit Ticket



On Your Mark, Ready, Set GO...



1. What Are We Eating?

Key Terms – Food Groups. When defining the terms and portions needed, show pictures and examples of the portion sizes. Fruits: Fruits contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Examples: bananas, grapefruit, grapes, oranges, apples, etc. (Nemours, 1995-2013) (Need 2 cups per day) Examples: bananas, grapefruit, grapes, oranges, apples, etc. (United States Department of Agriculture, n.d.)

Vegetables: Vegetables contain vitamins and minerals and are low in calories and high in fiber. (Nemours, 1995-2013) (Need 2.5 cups per day) Examples:Tomatoes, celery, lettuce, green beans, carrots, etc.

Grains: There are two types of grains, whole and refined grains. Whole grains, such as wheat flour, contain nutrients and fiber. Refined grains, such as white flour, lose the vitamins, minerals, and fiber when processed. (Nemours, 1995-2013) (Need 6 ounces per day) Examples: breads, pasta, oatmeal, cereals, tortillas, grits, etc. (United States Department of Agriculture, n.d.)

Protein: Protein helps build, maintain, and repair body tissue. (Nemours, 1995-2013) (Need 5.5 ounces per day) Examples: meats, poultry, seafood, beans, peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, etc. (United States Department of Agriculture, n.d.)

Dairy: Dairy foods contain calcium that is necessary for growth and strong bones and teeth. Calcium fortified soy milk is also in this food group. (Nemours, 1995-2013) (Need 3 cups per day) Examples: fluid milk products and foods made from milk and mild (United States Department of Agriculture, n.d.)





2. MyPlate Relay

Split class into groups of 5.

Post a set of food pictures on the board for each group. Include 3 examples from each food group.

Provide each group with a MyPlate worksheet.

Have each group line up single file in front of their group of pictures.

When you say, “Go!” the first student in line runs to the board, grabs a food picture, runs to his or her group, high-fives the next person in line to release him or her,then places the food picture on the plate.

The next student does the same thing, ideally choosing a food from a different food group.

If one student brings back a picture from a food group that is already completed, another must use his or her turn to return it to the board.

The group who completes a MyPlate meal first wins.



3. Why Plan?

Read the following prompt and direct the students to contrast the benefits of and barriers to eating the appropriate balance of food in the appropriate portion size.

Use the class handout to record answers.

Place the two headings, Benefits Of and Barriers To, on the board and ask one person from each group to share a response.

Review.

Read them the following prompt: Sara and Karen are sisters. They do not like the school lunches so they skip them. After school they are hungry and usually stop at the convenience store to buy soda and chips. They remembered the food label class in health, read that the soda and chips contained two servings, but were hungry and ate everything. When they arrived at Karen’s house, they were still hungry and ate some cookies and milk. Neither was hungry at dinner-time, so they ate little. When it was time to do homework, they could not concentrate and failed to complete their assignments. The next day, each decided to pack her own lunch. They made turkey sandwiches with two pieces of turkey and mustard. They cut up an apple and put it in a single serving size container and bought milk. They had a good afternoon, concentrated on their schoolwork, had energy throughout the day, and were not hungry after school.





Benefits of eating appropriately the balance of food in the serving size

Distribute the handout, How much food is right for me?

Distribute the class activity prompt, Anniversary Party

In groups, using newsprint, draw a MyPlate and fill it in with a balance of anniversary food in the appropriate serving sizes.

As a reference, use the handout, How Much Food Is Right For Me?

Share.



Anniversary Party

Pedro and Juan are visiting their grandmother and grandfather’s house on Sunday to celebrate the couple’s 30 th wedding anniversary.

Both are a bit overweight and trying hard to think of MyPlate food groups and portion sizes when they eat. At home it is pretty easy because the family is trying to eat healthy, and each member encourages the other to be mindful of eating a variety of foods at the appropriate portion size.

The menu at the anniversary party includes cheese, crackers, olives, strawberries, pineapple, grapes, chips and dip, spaghetti, meatballs, salad, roasted chicken, green beans, corn, gravy, rolls and butter, anniversary cake, and ice cream.

Help the boys plan a strategy to eat a balanced meal from the food groups in the appropriate portion size.



5. MindUP Module: Mindful in the Moment

Note to the facilitator - Make packets for each student prior to class. Place the stations 1 - 6 around the room and provide chairs for the students to sit. Make six copies of the formative assessment smile/frown faces and place one at each station for students to communicate their progress or ask for help

1. How to Keep Healthy

Note to the facilitator— Set up and equip five stations around the room prior to class. (#1 skin, #2 teeth, #3 eyes, #4 ears, #5 hair and nails, #6 spine)

Station 1 - Skin - Purpose of the skin, Model of the structure of the skin, Sun tan lotion SPF 15 or higher, pictures of melanoma, pictures of body tattoos and piercings.

Station 2 - Teeth - Image of structure of the tooth, Model of how to floss, Model of how to brush

Station 3 - Eyes - Image of the eye, UV protected sun glasses, Sport glasses

Station 4 - Ears - Image of the ear, baseball helmet, wide brimmed hat, ear plugs

Station 5 - Hair and nails - Image of hair follicle, MyPlate, shampoo, nail clipper, nail file

Station 6 - Spine - Image of the Spine, Image of Subluxation and Nerve Chart, Spinal Model if available

As the students enter the classroom, give them a Stickie with the number #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Direct the students to sit at the station with the same number and look at the backup information. Students have 5 minutes to review the backup material and video.

Students take with them the backup materials as they move from one station to the next.





Direct the students to put the Stickie on their shirts and go to a different station. One person stays at a home station. Each station now contains a group of students who display a #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The person whose number matches the station presents for four minutes. The presentation guidelines at each station are the same as the backup minus the detail.

Students may use their backup materials for their presentation.

If video is used, the student must make sure it is ready for the next student.





With a signal from the teacher, the group moves to the next station, and the person with its number presents for four minutes.

Continue until students have visited each station.

Students return to their original location.



2. Our Health Matters

Have the students fill out their predictions. Students may use backup information to complete the task.

Once students complete their predictions, share their answers.

Predict what happens when you do or do not keep: Predict what happens when you do or do not keep your skin healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep your teeth healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep your eyes healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep your ears healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep your hair and nails healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep your spine healthy.

Predict what would happen if you did/did not keep awareness of the importance of self-care and compassion for yourself (taking care of your emotional well-being/needs?)

How does practicing self-care/compassion for others enhance our relationships with ourselves and others?





3. Stop and Review: What Can We Do?



Ask students for tips on keeping different parts of the body healthy: Hair and nails

Eyes

Ears

Teeth

Skin

Spine





Explain that part of keeping the spine healthy is to make sure that, when sitting or standing, you maintain your posture.

Demonstrate the following Posture Pod (Life University, 2013) exercises as a class to keep the spine in shape: The Eagle: Stand up tall and straight. Put your arms straight out and pull your shoulders together in the back. Breathe air in and slowly raise your arms until your hands touch together over your head.

Breathe air out and slowly lower your arms to your side.

Repeat 3 to 5 times.





The Hummingbird: Stand up tall and straight. Put your arms out to the side with your hands up and pull your shoulders together in the back. Make small backward circles with your hands and arms.

Bend at your waist from side to side while you continue circling.

Continue to the count of 10 !





The Butterfly: Stand up tall and straight. Put your arms behind your head and gently pull your elbows backward. Slowly and gently press your head against your hands while you count to 2 .

Relax and breathe.

Repeat this 3 times.





Tell the students: if exercise hurts, don’t do it!

1. Do Now

List 3 components of a HEALTHY relationship and 3 of an unhealthy relationship.



2. Intro

Post the following 3 questions on the board; put students in groups to brainstorm answers. Once they are done, have them share out. What does the word relationship mean? The condition or fact of being related; connection or association.

Connection by blood or marriage; kinship.

A particular type of connection existing between people related to or having dealings with each other: has a close relationship with his siblings.

A romantic or sexual involvement.





Who can we have a relationship with?

Why are relationships important?





Types of Relationships Discussion: Have students rejoin their groups and ask them to draw their answers to the following questions: What type of relationships are there? What do they look like? Family

Friends

Casual

Romantic





Share out answers.





3. What are Relationships?

Have students share DO NOW answers by calling up characteristics of healthy and unhealthy relationships. Have a discussion about which are the most and least important.

Relationship Abuse Discussion: Ask students if they know what relationship abuse is.

Four Types of Relationship Abuse: Emotional: Doing or saying something as a means of hurting, without necessarily being physical. Trying to hurt other’s feelings as a means of controlling or gaining power. (Also called mental, psychological or verbal abuse).

Economic: Using economic or financial means to control another person’s activities or to undermine opportunities to become financially independent in order to make him or her dependent on the abuser.

Physical: Any behavior meant to cause harm to another’s body or to restrain or control ability to move or be free.

Sexual: Any sexual behavior that uses physical force, coercion or manipulation to make unwanted advances. Includes sexual harassment.





4. Relationship Scenarios

Hang four signs (numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4) in each corner of the room. Inform students that you will read a relationship situation. Each situation calls for a decision to be made and you will give them four choices. They must make a decision about that situation and move to the corner of the room that indicates their choice. Remind students that there is no right answer in each situation. This exercise is intended to clarify their values and opinions about relationships (and also helps students get a feel about what their personal deal breakers are – especially in friendships). Give students an opportunity to discuss why they made the decision they did. Depending on how much time you have, this can be a quick or drawn-out activity. If possible, try and project these scenarios on the board, so students can read the scenarios themselves while you read them. Otherwise, students will most-likely ask you to repeat the scenario/choices a million times.

Scenarios: Max - “I’ve cheated on my girlfriend a few times, but they were mistakes. She kind of knows about them but she never brings it up, so I guess it doesn’t bother her. Lately I’ve been wondering if I should fess up about what I’ve done.” Choice 1 - Honesty is the best policy. You should tell her.

Choice 2 - Maybe she doesn’t want to know. She could be cheating too.

Choice 3 - Don’t tell, as long as you don’t ever do it again.

Choice 4 - You’re obviously not happy in the relationship, break up.





Monique - “My best friend has been dating this guy Jason and she thinks she is in love with him. He’s such a player and I saw him kissing another girl at the movies. I’m not sure if I should tell my friend since she really likes him.” Choice 1 - Don’t tell, it’s not your business

Choice 2 - Definitely tell her, she needs to know he’s playing around.

Choice 3 - Talk to Jason and demand that he confess to your friend.

Choice 4 - Try and hint to your friend without being direct about it.





Jessica - “I cheated on my boyfriend because the relationship had become so predictable and I needed some excitement. He never found out and I’m not sure if I should tell him.” Choice 1 - Come clean and tell your boyfriend the truth.

Choice 2 - Tell him you’re bored and try to improve your relationship.

Choice 3 - Do nothing, what he doesn’t know can’t hurt him.

Choice 4 - Break up - face it, it’s over.





Samantha - “I just started seeing Matt, who is such a sweetie. Now David, this hottie I’ve had a crush on all year, is totally into me. I wanna hook up with David this weekend, but I don’t want to hurt Matt.” Choice 1 - Hook up with Lee, you’re not that serious with Matt anyway.

Choice 2 - Talk to Matt about ending things.

Choice 3 - Tell Lee you’re interested, but taken.

Choice 4 - Stay true to Matt, don’t hook up with Lee.





Amy - “My best friends has been starting to date this much older guy, she’s 15 and he’s like 21. She says she likes him because he’s more mature than the boys our age, he buys her stuff and he has a car. I know he’s been asking her to have sex with him. I have a really bad feeling about this guy. I don’t know if I should tell her what I think.” Choice 1 - Stay out of it, it’s none of your business.

Choice 2 - You should tell her your concerns about him being so much older than her, she is your best friend.

Choice 3 - What this guy is doing is illegal! You should tell her parents.

Choice 4 - Go straight to the guy and ask him what he wants with your friend.





Melissa - “My friend Nicole has been having sex with her boyfriend, and I know they aren’t using birth control. She told me she’s afraid to get on the pill because she doesn’t want to get fat and he doesn’t like condoms because they don’t feel as good. They are doing the pull-out method. I just learned in health class that the pull-out method is not very effective. Should I tell her she’s playing with fire?” Choice 1 - Tell her today! She should also know she can get an STD that way.

Choice 2 - The pull-out method is better than nothing, don’t say anything.

Choice 3 - So what if she gets pregnant, it would be fun to have a baby around.

Choice 4 - Tell her, and tell her you also learned that the pill doesn’t make you fat. Take her to the nearest clinic.





5. Evaluating a Relationship

Instruct students to pick a relationship that means something to them. This can be a significant other, friends, family member, anybody! Just make sure it is an important relationship. Tell students to turn over their handout and fill out questions. This sheet will only be graded for completion, not for right or wrong answers.



6. MindUP Module: Motives for Movement

What is mindful movement and its connection to exercise? Ask students how athletes check in on their bodies; answer: they monitor their pulse.

Demonstrate and, as a class, try the different ways to check one's pulse: Hold one palm up; press the index and middle finger of the other hand to your wrist just below your palm;

Press the index and middle finger at the top of your neck, just under your jaw (midway between the earlobe and chin);

Press your index and middle finger firmly at the center of the base of the throat.

Advocacy: Taking a stand on an issue and trying to influence others to show support. (Bronson, 2009, p. 39)

Bullying: The deliberate, repetitive, harming or threatening by an individual or group with more power. Bullies target victims who don’t fit in because of how they look or behave, their race, religion or sexual orientation. Bullying is physical, psychological, and verbal. (The Nemours Foundation, 2010)

Communication techniques include but are not limited to video, public service announcements, posters, public presentations, a song, a poem, specialty messages such as a valentine heart with an anti-bullying message, a fall colored leaf with an anti-bullying message, a spring flower with an anti-bullying message on it, etc.

Perspective Taking: the ability to see situations and events from the viewpoint of another person.

3. Bullying Bust! Advocating Against Bullying

Ask students if they know what it means to advocate for something.

Explain advocacy: Taking a stand on an issue and trying to influence others to show support. (Bronson, 2009, p. 39)

Read the story, The Table, to students: My older sister was bullied growing up. She had virtually no friends up until high school and used to get in the car after school and cry nearly every day. It was beyond painful for me to see her deal with that and I would never wish it on anyone.

I went to the same school my sister did and my best friend, Bekah, and I decided that we were going to eliminate bullying in our grade. We started by finding the kids in our class that were tortured the most by our classmates and ate with them every lunch.

Then we started to partner with them on projects, talk to them outside of class, and hang out with them after school. Some upper classmen saw what we were doing and joined in with us.

Together we formed The Table, a group made up of a mix of the most popular and most bullied kids from 7th grade to Seniors. The people I met by forming this group are some of the best people I have ever met and are all still my friends today.

The youngest of the original group all graduated last year, but my sister, Bekah, and I passed on the legacy to our younger brother and to this day bullying in our school has all but disappeared. I want to encourage everyone on this site that it can be done.

We can stop bullying in schools. Take a stand, and never give up. You are more brave than you give yourself credit for.

By: Rachele, 19, Texas (Pacer Center Incorporated, 2012)





In groups, ask students to answer the following questions: How did Rachel advocate against bullying? She found victims of bullying and ate lunch with them

Partnered with victims when school projects were assigned

Talked to the victims outside of class

Hung out with the victims after school

Upper classmen joined the effort

The group formed The Table

Advocacy continued after they left the school





Was the advocacy effective? Why? Yes, bullying has almost disappeared in the school.





Explain that today we are going to adapt healthy messages and communication techniques that would help the teens in the first three stories.

Refer to the Student Support Materials for an explanation of communication techniques and examples. Other holiday and seasonal messages are also appropriate.

Each group design a health message to advocate for the victim in their story. Ask students to include one strategy to stop bullying on their poster. Examples of a health message could be: Mo bullying, mo problems.

Being cruel is not cool.

Key Terms

Evolution: A process of continuous change from a lower, simpler or worse to a higher, more complex state.

Glycemic Load: An index indicating the amount of carbohydrate contained in a specified serving of a particular food.

Fatty Acid: Fatty acids are the building blocks of the fat in our bodies and in the food we eat. During digestion, the body breaks down fats into fatty acids, which can then be absorbed into the blood. (Nemours, 1995-2014) Fatty acids have many important functions in the body, including energy storage. If glucose (a type of sugar) isn't available for energy, the body uses fatty acids to fuel the cells instead.

Key Terms

Healthy behaviors - Things that people do that counteract or reduce health risks such as not smoking, eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol consumption. (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011)

Healthy practices - Behaviors that people repeat (or practice) that contribute to health such as exercising 60 minutes each day.

Health status - Your physical and mental health condition. (HealthCare.gov, 2013)

Predict - To foretell based on observation, experience or scientific reason. (Merriam Webster, n.d.)



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Do Now

Ask students to answer the following question: Are all calories bad?

Discuss their answers. Explain that calories are needed to help the body function, and that today you’ll be looking at calorie input and output in terms of weight management.



2. Match It Up Relay!

Split the students into teams, with maximum of 5 members per team.

Distribute the terms to students.

In front of each team, place the key terms definitions on the board.

As a team, they need to figure out which key terms definitions go with which specific key terms in their hand. Give them 2 minutes to do this.

Once the time is up, each team lines up; one person brings up a definition, matches it up to the word, and then goes to the end of their line. Next person goes as such, and continues until all of their words are posted.

Once their words are posted, have them do some kind of physical exercise, i.e. jumping jack, sit up, as a team to show their done.

First team with correct definitions and all correctly completing their exercise wins.



3. Why Work Out?

Engage the students by telling them that they are going see how well they predict the effects of regular exercise. Ask the following questions and students respond by using the True/False 3 x 5 cards. Students can keep the same teams as the Match It Up Relay if manageable for the facilitator. Another option is to split the class into three teams. In 2011, 10% of high school students participated in 60 minutes of physical activity 7 days before the survey. False . In 2011, 29% of high school students participated in 60 minutes of physical activity 7 days before the survey. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012)

Discussion - Although 29% is better than 10%, the number of students exercising 60 minutes a day is slightly more than 30%.





Physical inactivity and poor diet can result in overweight and obesity and increase the possibility of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, arthritis, and overall poor health status. True . (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012)





Exercise can improve your mood. True . Exercise causes the body to release endorphins which are chemicals that help people feel more peaceful and happy. (Nemours, 2012)





Exercise has no effect on how well you will perform in school. False . Exercise does help increase academic performance by increasing concentration and being more attentive. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012)





Exercise does not affect how well you sleep. False . Moderate activity three hours before you go to sleep helps relax you. (Bronson, 2009)





Being physically fit increases self-esteem. True . Increased activity can result in more self confidence because you know you look good, feel good, and have a sense of accomplishment. (Bronson, 2009)





There are social benefits of being fit. True . Friendships may develop from being on the same team or enjoying the same activity. (Bronson, 2009)





4. Balancing Basics

Post the 3 Balancing Graphics on the board.

Ask a student volunteer to explain each graphic (how to gain, maintain, or lose weight).



5. Carrie’s Challenge

Distribute the prompt, food log, activity chart, and blank table to the class.

Read this prompt to the class. Carrie is 15 years old. Her BMI is in the Healthy range. Although she has kept a healthy weight, sometimes her weight goes up and she doesn’t understand why. She is moderately active and should be consuming no more than 2,200 calories.





Ask students if they think they are burning calories while sitting in class (T/F). Explain to students that our bodies are always using energy, but at different rates depending on activity level, age, height, weight, and gender. You use energy no matter what you’re doing. The Basal Metabolic Rate calculates how many calories you would burn even in you just stayed in bed all day and takes into account your age, height, weight and age. Carrie’s BMR = 1,600 calories.





Examples of other students:





Tell the students the following: YOUR CHALLENGE is to show Carrie how much physical activity is needed to wear off the calories she consumed in one day and the changes she must make to maintain a healthy weight. (Consume less - 2,200 calories per day + physical activity)





Carrie’s food log for one day





Click on the image above to view the table



Table of physical activities and caloric usage



Activity Calorie Used In One Half Hour

Jumping rope 420

Jogging at 7 miles per hour 400

Soccer 300

Slow swimming 200

Leisure cycling 140

Calisthenics 130

Basketball (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011)

220

Walking 3 mph

120

Carrie’s intake of calories is 2715 in one day. She burns 1,600 through her Basal Metabolic Rate.

List the physical exercises she must perform, how much time she must exercise, and the total calories expended to wear off the food she ate. (Total Calorie Intake – BMR = 2,715 – 1,600 = 1,115 calories total)

Activity Amount of time Calorie Usage for One Half Hour





Total (must be as close to 1, 115 as possible)



REFLECTION - What healthy dietary suggestions can you give Carrie to reduce 515 calories from her diet and bring her calorie intake down to 2,200? Be specific.





REFLECTION - How does balancing calorie intake with exercise maintain or improve personal health?





When students have completed the table, they exchange their paper with another group to check for accuracy and completeness.

Return the papers.

Discuss. If Carrie wanted to lose weight, what should she to do?

If Carrie wanted to gain weight, what should she do?





6. STOP and Review: Thumbs Up/Down



Use thumbs up/thumbs down to review the class content. Thumbs up is true, thumbs down is false. Examples of healthy behaviors include not smoking, eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol consumption. (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011) True

Healthy practices are activities that people practice that contribute to health such as exercising 60 minutes each day. True

Health status is how you feel about your physical and mental health. (HealthCare.gov, 2013) False

Health status – your physical and mental health condition. True

Predict means to look into the future based on observation, experience or scientific reason. (Merriam Webster, n.d.) True

To lose weight, take in more calories that you burn off. False ; Take in fewer calories than you burn off.

To maintain weight, take in the same number of calories you burn off. True





To gain weight, take in fewer calories than you burn off. False ; Take in more calories than you burn off.

Understanding Diabetes




YOU will learn...



Identify different types of diabetes and their causes.

Explain how diabetes can affect you and what you can do to prevent diabetes.



Bell to Bell



Today’s Agenda

Do Now

Where It All Starts or Watering the Seeds

How Diabetes Works

Diabetes Bingo/Tic-Tac-Toe

Bonus Activity: Dunkin’ On Diabetes

STOP and Review: Exit Ticket



On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Do Now

Have students gather together in pairs or small groups. Ask them to discuss the following questions. Do know anyone with diabetes?

What causes diabetes?

Can we prevent diabetes?





Share out answers.

Point of Emphasis: There are two types of diabetes. They can be caused for different reasons. We’ll discuss those today. We will also find out how we can prevent and even control diabetes depending on which type a person has.

(SPECIAL NOTE): Be careful using the word reverse to your students. Reversing symptoms is possible but if the lifestyle is not kept up, diabetes can come right back. Focus on controlling diabetes and putting it in “remission”.



2. Where It All Starts

In groups pass out the following questions to the students. Using the definitions on the board, ask them to answer the questions. Where do nutrients get absorbed from the digestive system?

When nutrients get absorbed, where do they go?

What nutrients do we know take longer to digest?

What nutrients take only a short amount of time to digest?





Definitions posted on the board: Pancreas: The organ that helps release the hormone insulin into your blood stream. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot release insulin.

Insulin: A hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches, and other foods into energy needed for daily life. In Type 1 diabetes, this does not happen.

Glucose: A fancy name for sugar. It is very important for our bodies to survive. If your body doesn’t use glucose properly, it can become unhealthy.

Type 1 Diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow glucose to enter cells to produce energy.

Type 2 Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body’s main source of fuel.





Point of Emphasis : “Diabetes is in our control. Our food choices dictate what happens in our body. If we put unnecessary stress on our entire body, it will eventually break down. Food matters. Healthy food matters. Now we’ll discuss what is happening inside the body for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.”



3. Watering the Seeds

Ask students if they believe that diabetes is genetic? (Meaning it can be passed down through the family tree) Most should say yes. Instruct students, “Raise your hand if you feel that diabetes could be passed down to you?” Then say, “Let’s talk about how we have choices when it comes whether or not we open that gift.”

Grab a dry erase marker. Go to the board. Draw out a garden; feel free to use your creative talents and/or stick figures. Draw out a few seeds planted under the ground. Ask the students if those seeds will grow if we do nothing to it. No water. No fertilizer. No sun. What happens? Nothing. Okay, what happens if they get sun everyday, watered frequently, and are covered with fertilizer. They grow big!

Now imagine if each one of those seeds we drew represents a different preventable disease that might be passed down to us through our genes. Ask the class for examples. You should hear, “Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc.” What happens if we don’t water these seeds? Nothing. Ask, “What kinds of things in our life can help water, provide sunlight, or fertilize these diseases?” You should hear, “Not exercising. Eating unhealthy foods, etc.”

Point of Emphasis : We have a choice on whether or not we supply our own seeds with the fuel to grow into a full disease. Don’t give it a reason to grow!



4. Activity 1: How Diabetes Works

One student holds a “PANCREAS” Sign

One student holds a sign “INSULIN”

Three students get beach balls labeled “GLUCOSE”

One student holds a plastic bin labeled “CELL”

Lay out a piece of red material or butcher paper on the ground (felt works well!)

PANCREAS and INSULIN stand together in one corner of the room, while the “red carpet” is in the middle of the room. CELL stands in the other corner of the room. Have students act out the following scenarios: Normal process in a healthy body, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes. Go through the following three demos:

Healthy This is how it would work in your body, without diabetes. You eat a banana. This banana is digested and glucose is absorbed into the blood through the small intestine. (Have students throw glucose beach balls into the blood) Now that it’s in the blood, it needs to go somewhere! Ask the class: Where does it need to go? Answer: The cell! Point to the student on the other side of the room with the cell bin. Insulin’s job is to deliver glucose into the cell. (The pancreas should push, gently, the insulin onto the felt. Tell insulin to go into the blood and deliver glucoses into the cell).

Example T1D: Everything’s the same except that insulin never gets pushed into the cell by the pancreas (Because the pancreas is on permanent vacation. Have the pancreas person actually leave the room). The glucose remains in the bloodstream. No energy is ever delivered to the cell!

Example T2D : Everything’s the same except that insulin only has one hand to deliver glucose to the cell. It can take some of the glucose but not all of it, leaving the blood glucose level higher. Oral medication, extra insulin, diet, and exercise can help insulin get its missing hand back!





Ask the class, what’s would be the difference in beach balls aka glucose if I ate a candy bar instead of an apple? Answer - It would be as if everyone in the class had a beach ball and we all threw them on the red carpet at the same time!

Also use this as an opportunity to explain how the pancreas gets tired with a high processed food diet. It’s not just sugary foods that cause diabetes, it’s the fatty foods too that cause the body to need more insulin. Make sure to emphasize how the fiber in the apple helps slow the release of glucose into the blood while the candy bar does not.



5. Activity 2: Diabetes Bingo//Tic-Tac-Toe

Read the definition and students cross out the word if they have it. Once a student gets 3 in a row, they call out DIABETES!

Fill in worksheet with a combination of the following words. Note: If you make 15 worksheet variations and planned out the placement of words so no student would get DIABETES until the 11 th or 12 th word. INSULIN - The hormone released by our pancreas that allows glucose to leave our bloodstream. With type one diabetes, the pancreas cannot release this hormone.

TYPE 1 - The type of diabetes that is not preventable.

TYPE 2 - The type of diabetes that is caused by a number of factors including genetics, overweight, high sugar/high fat diet, lack of exercise, among other things.

PANCREAS - The organ that creates insulin.

GLUCOSE - A fancy name for sugar in our blood. It is very important for our bodies to survive. If your body doesn’t use THIS properly, it can become unhealthy.

SUGAR - Eating too much of this carbohydrate overtime, typically found in soda and candy, can lead to weight gain and type 2 diabetes.

BLOOD - Glucose stays here until insulin allows it to pass into the cells that need energy.

INCREASE - Levels of sugar, or glucose, in the blood does THIS after eating a lot of sugar or carbohydrates.

SMALL INTESTINE - After eating food, this is where 98% of nutrients, including sugar, is absorbed into the blood.

INSULIN DEPENDENT - This is the condition where you must have insulin from an outside source, usually delivered by pump or injection.

A person can add these two things to their diet to help prevent diabetes: FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

OVERWORKED & EXHAUSTED - When a person with diabetes eats a lot of sugary foods, their pancreas becomes___________.

CARBOHYDRATE - This macronutrient is the first to be digested in the stomach and small intestine.

GESTATIONAL - This is the name for diabetes that develops while a woman is pregnant.

EXERCISE - Doing this activity is important for people with diabetes and also to prevent diabetes. It lowers blood glucose levels, and helps insulin work for efficiently.

PRE-DIABETES - This means that your blood sugar levels are higher than the normal range but lower than the diabetes range.

DIABETES SYMPTOMS - Frequent urination, blurry vision, excessive thirst, and excessive tiredness.

ENERGY - Glucose gives THIS to your cells.





6. BONUS ACTIVITY - Dunking on Diabetes

Get one of those hang on a door basketball goals. Hang it somewhere in the room. Place a piece of paper on the backboard that says “Cell”.

Get a ball ready that says “Glucose” on it.

Make a lanyard that has the nametag “Insulin”.

Make a stripe with tape on the floor for the free throw line shot.

Find online the percentage of people with diabetes in your state. Place that percentage on the board. Create two categories next to it: Diabetes and No Diabetes.

Invite students to come up to the line and be “insulin”. They do their job successfully if they shoot the “Glucose” into the “Cell”. If they miss the shot, they in essence have diabetes. Create a tally on the board. Allow 10-15 students to come up and shoot. See if your class beats the percentage of your state.

For an additional component, add in a “defense” of 2-3 students that try to distract the insulin from making the glucose into the cell. They’re names can be “Lack of Exercise”, “Fast Food”, “Processed Foods”, “Soda”, etc.



7. STOP and Review: Exit Ticket



Answer ONE of the following questions in 2 or more sentences. What happens in the body when a person with diabetes eats sugar?

Why is it important to know how different foods affect our bodies differently?

Have you had a personal experience with diabetes that you would like to share?

How could having diabetes affect your life? Will it affect your dreams? What can we do today to prevent it?

Food Allergy Prompt: First Day Impressions “My most embarrassing moment with my food allergies happened when I was 7 years old. It was my first day of second grade. At the beginning of class, my teacher made an announcement about a special student with special requirements. The teacher stated that “no student should bring peanuts in the classroom for a snack.” She also made it clear that no student should come into physical contact with this student if they had eaten peanuts. Naturally, it was important the students know who this “special student” was, so the teacher informed them. I was embarrassed. I wanted to run out of the room. I knew the other kids didn’t understand me or my allergies. I was so embarrassed to have the entire class learn about my food allergies in that way.”~John

Ask for volunteers to share what they wrote. As people share, have them tear off their stickers, and throw them away. Even if students don’t share, have them all stand in the circle and count them down to ripping off their stickers.

Tell the students that we can’t help how we are born, so we need to start embracing these things we don’t love as things that make us beautiful. Rip off your sticker and this will be the last time you see that trait as something negative.



2. Student Scenarios: Melissa and Annie

Pass out the Student Scenarios: Melissa and Annie handout.

Ask for two volunteers. Each will read a scenario. While students are reading, walk around the room and place a #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 chip on each student’s desk. Use these chips to place students in groups for the skill portion of the lesson.

Scenario #1 – Melissa is very confident about applying for a job at the supermarket. She wore her nicest outfit, fixed her hair, and practiced what she would say to the manager. She knows she has good computer skills and is sure she can learn how to use the register in a short period of time.

Scenario #2 – Annie needs a job and she heard that there is an opening at the supermarket. She doesn’t have many skills and doesn’t think the manager will hire her because she is not pretty or outgoing.





Ask the students Who do you think will get the job? (Melissa)

Why? (She has confidence)

If Melissa gets the job, how will that affect her health status? (She will feel happy, confident, excited, respected, valued)

If Annie does not get the job, how will that affect her health status? (She will feel sad, not confident, not valued)

What is the term that describes how much you value, respect, and feel confident about your self? (Self- Esteem) (Bronson, 2009, p. 68)

What is the term that describes how you view your physical self? (Body image)

What effect does positive self-esteem and positive self-image have on your health status? (Brainstorm a list with your students)

What effect does negative self-esteem and negative self-image have on your health status? (Brainstorm a list with your students)





3. Learning to Like YOU!

Place students in pairs or small groups.

Distribute Flipchart paper

Distribute “Tips for a Top-Notch Self-Esteem and Body Image” and “Background Basics”

Students use “Tips for a Top-Notch Self-Esteem and Body Image” and “Background Basics” to respond to the following questions on the Flip Chart paper. (Refer to back up materials) How does a teen develop or maintain positive self-esteem?

How does positive self-esteem affect health status?

How does a teen develop negative self-esteem?

How does negative self-esteem affect health status?

List three things that can be done to improve self-esteem?

How does a teen develop or maintain positive self-image?

How does positive self-image affect health status?

How does a teen develop negative self-image?

How does negative self-image affect health status?

List three things that can be done to improve self-image?





Share



4. Role Play: Help Each Other Out

Divide the class into five groups, using the numbered chips distributed during Student Scenarios: Melissa and Annie .

In groups, students design a role-play in which one student is a student at the school, one student is the guidance counselor, and the other student is a parent.

Design a role-play where the parent discovers the poor self-esteem and body image of his/her child and is looking for help from the school. The guidance counselor explains how poor self-esteem and poor body image may lead to eating disorders. The mother is concerned because members of their family might have an eating disorder.

Use the handouts from the first half of the lesson.

After a few minutes, take turns demonstrating how the counselor used resources from the school and community to help the teen. Include actions the parent can do at home.



5. STOP and Review: Pair Share:



Pair up students.

Each picks a question to answer to each other: What is the term that describes how much you value, respect, and feel confident about your self? (Self-esteem)

How does having positive self-esteem affect your health status?

1. Do Now:

Have students sit in small groups and draw a numbered card for the number of hours they sleep. 0, 3 , 5, 8, 10 hours, etc.)

After each group draws a number, ask its members to share how they would think, feel, or act after sleeping that number of hours. (Example: 3 hours - I would feel tired and anxious and would drink more caffeine to stay awake).



2. Why So Sleepy?

Place the chart below on the board.

In groups, ask students to list why getting solid sleep is good for you (benefits) and why it is hard to get good sleep (barriers).

After they’ve completed this, come back together and make a class list.

As a group, list ways to overcome those barriers.





3. Sleep Scenarios

Provide students sleep scenarios and have them complete the sheet. Direct them to brainstorm how they could change the character’s environment to produce a better night’s sleep. Choose a student to come to the front of the classroom and share or act it.

Explain that most people don’t realize how much they sleep, where, and are essential to maintaining a healthy and balanced life. Sleep affects almost everything we do. Sleep plays a critical role in your attention span; how we sleep during the night usually affects our waking hours.



4. Sleep Facts

Have these sleep facts posted on flip chart paper in the room:

Regulate your sleep pattern: your body clock runs best when you stay consistent. Even on the weekends, rise within one hour of the time that you do on weekdays. Set a regular schedule and stick to it!

Change the temperature: the ideal setting is a cool, dark room. If you’re having trouble sleeping, remove a layer of clothing (like socks) or lower the thermostat.

Exercise: 5-6 hours prior to sleeping helps you fall asleep, but 3 hours prior to bedtime will stimulate you.

Eat small portions before bed.

Get regular exposure to daylight for at least twenty minutes per day. The light from the sun enters our eyes and triggers our brain to release specific chemicals and hormones, like melatonin.

Avoid substances that disturb sleep, including caffeine, sugar, alcohol and nicotine. 2.1 Get Your ZZZ's to Get Your AAA's

Use your bedroom for sleep only. (Working or watching TV gives your body mixed signals as to what should happen in your bedroom).

Relax your mind: avoid intense movies, television shows, and even some books with active plots. Read calming books that relax your mind but exhaust your eyes before bed.

Meditation and soothing music may relax your mind and signal your body to sleep.

Lights low and out: light reminds your body that it should be awake. Be sure to lower your lights and avoid bright lights, such as television and computer screens. If you have trouble sleeping, wear an eye mask. It will help your body produce melatonin.

Avoid napping more than 30 minutes during the day. This habit could keep you from falling asleep later. Mindless thinking will bore you and set your body and brain at ease.

Sleep - the ultimate relaxer! Quality and quantity of restful sleep are prerequisites for controlling negative thoughts.



5. Sleep Stations

Create sleep stations throughout the classroom and give students an opportunity to experience them. All of these activities could culminate in a sleeping kit that holds the pieces students worked on during class. Sleep stations include: Assemble lavender-satchels (this is calming and can be put under the pillow.)

Design and decorate sleeping masks.

Create calming music playlists.

Design sleep tip pillowcases from Sleep Facts or have students brainstorm their own as a class or individually.

Decorate dream book.

Create sleep schedules that accommodate a busy high school schedule.

Learn the cycles of sleep.

Design the ideal bedroom sleeping environment.

1. What is Time Management?

Students complete a THINK PAIR SHARE On your own, write down short definitions to the following terms: predict, time management, health status, and healthy behaviors.

Share those answers with your neighbor.

As a class, agree on class definitions of the key terms. Write them on the board next to the key term in the agenda. Terms should align with the following definitions: Predict means to estimate that (a specified thing) will happen in the future or will be a consequence of something.

Time management is the act or process of planning and exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on specific activities to increase efficacy and productivity.

Health Status is the level of health of the individual, group, or population.

Healthy Behaviors are actions taken by a person to maintain, attain, or retain good health and to prevent illness. Health behaviors reflect a person’s health beliefs such as exercising regularly or eating a balanced diet.





Explain how to predict by completing the Why Manage Time worksheet: Students read the scenarios and then complete the t-chart below. Anticipated answers are as follows: No Time Management: Sally will be stressed out because she was running late. Also, she is tired because she was unable to eat breakfast. She will be embarrassed for not knowing the answers to her teacher’s questions, and she will get frustrated because she has to stay after class. She will also be sad because she didn’t get to bring the lunch she made for that day.

Time Management: Sally wakes up on time in the morning, and feels relaxed. She feels full of energy because she has eaten her breakfast, and is prepared to leave for school. She arrives ready to learn and is confident to volunteer answers during math class.





2. Setting Your Goals

As a class, generate a list on why goal setting is important. Anticipated responses are as follows: Keeps you focused on what needs to be done

Can help in staying positive

Can make you feel like you are accomplishing things





Goal Setting Steps: As a class, generate own list of goal setting steps; a guide of those steps follows: Assess personal health practices

Develop a plan

Implement a plan and monitor progress

Formulate a long term, effective plan





3. Practice It!

On their own or in pairs, students complete the Setting Goals and Making a Schedule worksheet.

Once completed, ask students to share out some ideas that they came up with for their plan.

After students finish their schedules, recommend students take them home to run through it for a day or two.

On Your Mark: Ready, Set, Go...



1. Do Now:

Ask students to answer the following: If you had all the time in the world to make breakfast, what would you eat?

Share answers.



2. Why Do We Skip?

Put the chart listed below on the board.

Ask the students to complete their chart in groups or pairs.





Come back together as a group to create class lists.

Ask what is the main purpose of eating breakfast every morning? Have students generate a class list. Talking points: Breakfast is how we recharge our batteries. Students who don’t eat breakfast regularly perform poorly on tests requiring concentration, have shorter attention spans, achieve lower test scores, and are tardy or absent more often than well-fed students. It is better to eat something for breakfast, rather than skip it altogether—even if it is not as healthy as it should be.





Ask what are some reasons you do not eat breakfast? Capture student answers on the board in the second column. (Lack of time is usually the biggest reason that students cite for not eating breakfast.)

Explain that breakfast provides a burst of energy in the morning and keeps up your energy throughout the day. It refuels your mind and body after a long night’s sleep. Breakfast gives you the strength and endurance needed to perform your best when participating in physical activities or competing in sports. Breakfast is beneficial for your brain, memory, concentration, and mood, which help you perform better at work or in school. It may even help you get a better grade on your next exam!

If you find yourself running out the door without eating breakfast, you may want to rethink your decision. Depending on what is eaten, people who have a hearty, nutritious breakfast consume less fat and cholesterol and more vitamins and minerals than people who skip breakfast. Researchers recently reported that people who live to the age of 100 eat a regular breakfast more often than not.



3. Breakfast: Anytime, Anywhere

Explain: While most of us have busy mornings with little spare time, it is important to prioritize breakfast—even if it is something simple or prepared the night before. Here are some suggestions for quick and easy breakfast options: At Home: smoothies, whole wheat toast or whole-wheat English muffin and a slice of reduced-fat cheese, whole-grain toaster waffles with peanut butter and banana, whole grain cereal with fresh fruit and reduced-fat milk.

On the Go: individual or cereal bars, such as Nature Valley, Nutrigrain, Quaker Chewy Granola Bars, Special K Cereal Bars or Kashi Bars, single-serving, reduced-fat yogurt with a piece of fresh fruit (apple, orange, banana, pear, etc.), single-serving instant oatmeal in a cup with a piece of fresh fruit.

At the Local Diner, Deli or Bodega: scrambled eggs on whole- wheat toast (ask for veggies in the eggs), whole-wheat bagel with tomato and small amount of light cream cheese, whole-wheat toast with a slice of cheese.





4. Breaking Down Breakfast Cereals

Have you ever wonder how much cereal is considered a serving size? This activity demonstrates what a serving size of dry cereal is and how much sugar is in some of your favorite brands. Choose three students to sit at the table. Give each one flavor of cereal and a cereal bowl. Have each pour the amount of cereal he or she would normally eat in the morning.

Ask each of them to read the food label from his or her cereal box, tell the class the size of one serving, and show the class which measuring cups would be best for correct portion sizes.

Then, using measuring cups, each student can measure the cereal in his or her bowls and determine how many actual servings each contains. The results will be interesting!





Explain: Now we are going to look at the amount of sugar in a single serving of cereal.

Ask each student to read aloud from the food label on his or her cereal box. Ask each to tell the class how much sugar is contained in a single serving of his or her cereal.

We are now going to convert the grams of sugar into teaspoons; Hold up the teaspoon from the measuring spoon set to show students what it looks like. 4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar (or 1 sugar cube).

Examples: 1 serving of Cocoa Krispies = 1 cup cereal. Cocoa Krispies has 14 grams of sugar in 1 serving

There are over 3 teaspoons of sugar in 1 serving of Cocoa Krispies. 1 serving of Cheerios = 1 cup

Cheerios has 1 gram of sugar in 1 serving

There is ¼ teaspoon of sugar in 1 serving of Cheerios. Ask students to demonstrate how much sugar is contained in each serving of cereal by calculating the math formula. Using measuring spoons, a student can measure into plastic cups the amount of sugar per serving.





Ask: Look at the amount of sugar per serving in these cups. Is anyone surprised by these amounts? Is this more sugar than you thought would be in 1 serving?

Explain: The sugar in these cereals is ADDED and not the best choice. For a healthier breakfast choice instead, have a cereal with less added sugar. Add to your breakfast cereal fresh fruit, like strawberries or bananas, for a more balanced meal. Cereals that are high in sugar (Corn Pops, Cocoa Krispies, or Fruity Pebbles) are usually lacking in other health benefits, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Whole-grain cereals with minimal sugar (Cheerios or unfrosted shredded wheat) provide more fiber, are better for weight loss, and keep us more full for a longer time.



5. Something Tasty to Start the Day

Prepare a healthy and easy breakfast meal with your students. Show them that eating breakfast can be fun, quick, and something that will give them energy for the rest of the day.
