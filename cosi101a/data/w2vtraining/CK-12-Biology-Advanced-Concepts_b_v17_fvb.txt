The study of biology is the study of life. Concept Biology Advanced is the CK-12 Foundation's most extensive material describing the study of life. Concept Biology Advanced presents biology as a set of 18 concepts, with each concept centered around a specific category, such as cell biology or plants. Each concept is comprised of a series of lessons, with each lesson focusing on one specific topic. The complete Concept Biology Advanced is comprised of over 550 lessons. This material has been developed to complement the most advanced secondary-level biology course.





The Study of Life - Advanced


Introduction




Is there a way to define life ?

Scientifically, there is an actual definition of life . Living organisms must have certain characteristics. If they do not have these characteristics, are they living? This butterfly, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be alive ? This concept will answer this question. These lessons will serve as an introduction to biology, discussing The Study of Life and fundamental Principles of Biology.





Goals of Science


Define science.

List the principles that should guide scientific research.

Explain scientific skepticism.





What is science?

The goal of science is to learn how nature works by observing the natural and physical world, and to understand this world through research and experimentation. Science is a distinctive way of learning about the world through observation, inquiry, formulating and testing hypotheses, gathering and analyzing data, and reporting and evaluating findings. We are all part of an amazing and mysterious phenomenon called "life" that thousands of scientists everyday are trying to better understand. It is surprisingly easy to become part of this great discovery. All you need is an understanding of how people use the process of science to learn about the world and your natural curiosity.





Goals of Science


The term science is derived from the Latin word, scientia , which means “knowledge.” Science involves objective, logical, and repeatable experimental attempts to understand the principles and forces working in the natural universe. Science is an ongoing process of testing and evaluation, and is guided by a universal set of principles. One of the intended lessons of "Goals of Science" is for you to become more familiar with the scientific process.

Humans are naturally interested in the world we live in. Young children constantly pose the question "why". The goal of science is to answer these question . You may not realize it, but you are performing experiments all the time. For example, when you shop for groceries, you may end up carrying out a type of scientific experiment ( Figure below ). If you know you like Brand X of salad dressing but Brand Y is on sale, perhaps you will try Brand Y. If you end up liking Brand Y, you may buy it again even when it is not on sale. If you did not like Brand Y, not even a sale would entice you into buying it again. Your conclusions are essentially based on an experiment. To find out why a person might prefer a salad dressing over another, you might examine the cost, ingredient list, or packaging of the two salad dressings.



Figure 2.1

Shopping sometimes involves a little scientific experimentation. You are interested in inventing a new type of salad that you can pack for lunch. You might buy a vegetable or salad dressing that you have not tried before to discover if it would make an appealing addition to your salad. If you like it, you will probably buy it again. This is a type of experiment in which you have discovered a liking for something new.



There are many different areas of science, or scientific disciplines , but all scientific study involves:

asking questions

making observations

relying on evidence to form conclusions

being skeptical about ideas or results



Skepticism is an attitude of doubt about the truthfulness of claims that lack empirical evidence. Scientific skepticism , also referred to as skeptical inquiry, questions claims based on their scientific verifiability rather than simply accepting claims based on faith or anecdotes. Scientific skepticism uses critical thinking to analyze such claims and opposes claims which lack scientific evidence.





Vocabulary


experiment : A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already known; is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses until one hypothesis remains.

science : A distinctive way of learning about the natural world through observation, inquiry, formulating and testing hypotheses, gathering and analyzing data, and reporting and evaluating findings.

scientific skepticism : Questioning claims based on their scientific verifiability rather than accepting claims based on faith or anecdotes.





Summary


Scientific skepticism questions claims based on their scientific verifiability rather than accepting claims based on faith or anecdotes. Scientific skepticism uses critical thinking to analyze such claims and opposes claims which lack scientific evidence.

A Scientific View of the World


Examine a scientist’s view of the world.

Explain the relationship between science and nature.

Define scientific law.

Discuss why science is unable to answer all questions.





What would be a scientific view of the world ?

It could be said that the scientific view of the world is based on proven answers to specific questions. For example, "How old are recently identified fossils? What are the consequences of mutations in a certain gene? How does the endocrine system help maintain homeostasis?". These questions have definite answers which can help expand the scientific view of the world. Questions that cannot be answered with definitive answers, questions that cannot be proved with evidence, are not based on science. The scientific view of the world would not include answers to such questions.





A Scientific View of the World


Science is based on the analysis of observations made either through our senses or by using special equipment. Science therefore cannot explain anything about the natural world that is beyond what is observable. The term supernatural refers to entities, events, or powers regarded as being beyond nature, in that such things cannot be explained by scientific means. They are not measurable or observable in the same way the natural world is, and are therefore considered to be outside the realm of scientific examination.

When a natural occurrence which was previously considered supernatural is understood in the terms of natural causes and consequences, it has a scientific explanation. For example, the flickering lights sometimes seen hovering over damp ground on still evenings or nights are commonly called Will-o'-the-wisp . This phenomena looks like a lamp or flame, and is sometimes said to move away if approached. A great deal of folklore surrounds the legend, such as the belief that the lights are lost souls or fairies attempting to lead travelers astray. However, science has offered several potential explanations for Will-o'-the-wisp-- from burning marsh gases to glowing fungi, to animals that glow in a similar way to lightning bugs.

There is no single path that leads to scientific knowledge, and scientists do not follow a fixed set of steps when attempting to discover the answer to scientific questions. There are, however, certain specific features of scientific investigation. You do not have to be a professional scientist to think like a scientist. Everyone, including you, can use certain features of scientific thinking to analyze issues and situations in everyday life.

In science, it is assumed that the universe is a vast single system governed by basic rules and thus, things that are learned from studying one part of the universe can be applied to other parts of the universe. For example, the same principles of motion and gravitation that explain the motion of falling objects on Earth also explain the orbit of the planets around the sun, and galaxies, as shown in the Figure below . Thus nature, and what happens in nature, can be understood. However, as discussed below, as more and more information and knowledge is collected and understood, scientific ideas can change. Even though scientific knowledge usually stands the test of time, it cannot answer all questions.



Figure 2.2

With some changes over the years, similar principles of motion have applied to different situations. The same scientific principles that help explain planetary orbits can be applied to the movement of a Ferris wheel.





Nature Can Be Understood


In science, it is presumed that events in the universe happen in patterns that can be understood by careful study. Scientists believe that with the help of instruments that extend the human senses and our own careful observation and analysis, people can discover patterns in all of nature that can help us understand all facets of life, the world, and the universe.

Scientists think of nature as a single system controlled by natural laws. Scientists strive to increase their understanding of the natural world by discovering natural laws. Laws of nature are expressed as scientific laws. A scientific law is a statement that describes what always happens under certain conditions in nature.

An example of a scientific law is the law of gravity, which was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton (see Figure below ). The law of gravity states that objects always fall towards Earth because of the pull of gravity. Based on this law, Newton could explain many natural events. He could explain not only why objects such as apples always fall to the ground, but he could also explain why the moon orbits Earth. In addition to the laws of gravity, Newton also discovered laws of motion. His laws of motion allowed him to explain why objects move as they do.



Figure 2.3

Did Newton discover the law of gravity when an apple fell from a tree and hit him on the head? Probably not, but observations of nature are often the starting points for new ideas about the natural world.





Scientific Ideas Can Change


Science is a process for developing knowledge. Change in knowledge about the natural world is expected because there is often room for new observations which may challenge current views. No matter how well one theory explains a set of observations, it is possible that a different theory may explain them just as well or better, or may also encompass a wider range of observations. Scientists are always testing and attempting to improve theories. Scientists know that even if there is no way to gain complete knowledge about something, an increasingly accurate understanding of nature will develop over time.

The ability of scientists to make progressively more accurate predictions about the natural world, from determining how the smallest living organisms develop antibiotic resistance, to how "non-living" viruses continue to evolve, from how a cancerous tumor develops its own blood supply, to how mutations lead to cancer and other diseases, from trying to predict earthquakes, to calculating the orbit of an asteroid, provides evidence that scientists are gaining an understanding of how the world works.





Scientific Knowledge Can Stand the Test of Time


Continuity and stability are as much characteristics of science as change is. Although scientists accept some uncertainty as part of nature, most scientific knowledge stands the test of time. A changing of ideas, rather than a complete rejection of the ideas, is the usual practice in science. Powerful ideas about nature tend to survive, grow more accurate and become more widely accepted.

For example, in developing the theory of relativity, Albert Einstein did not throw out Issac Newton’s laws of motion but rather, he showed them to be only a small part of the bigger, cosmic picture. That is, the Newtonian laws of motion have limited use within our more general concept of the universe. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) uses the Newtonian laws of motion to calculate the flight paths of satellites and space vehicles.

The theory of evolution by natural selection is a classic example of a biological theory that has withstood the test of time. Developed over 150 years ago, a myriad of data has been collected to support Charles Darwin's theory. So far, no scientific information has been uncovered to contradict or counteract this scientific theory.





Science Cannot Offer Answers to All Questions


There are many things that cannot be examined in a scientific way. There are, for instance, beliefs that cannot be proved or disproved, such as the existence of supernatural powers, supernatural beings, or the meaning of life. In other cases, a scientific approach to a question and a scientific answer may be rejected by people who hold to certain beliefs.

Scientists do not have the means to settle moral questions surrounding good and evil, or love and hate, but they can sometimes contribute to the discussion of such issues by identifying the likely reasons for certain actions by humans and the possible consequences of these actions.





Vocabulary


science : A distinctive way of learning about the natural world through observation, inquiry, formulating and testing hypotheses, gathering and analyzing data, and reporting and evaluating findings.

scientific law : A principle which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world.

scientist : An individual who uses the scientific method; a person who engages in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge.





Summary


Science is based on the analysis of things that humans can observe either by themselves through their senses, or by using special equipment. Science therefore cannot explain anything about the natural world that is beyond what is observable by current means. Supernatural things cannot be explained by scientific means.

What is the method of science?

How is science "done?" It can be difficult sometimes to define research methods in a way that will clearly distinguish science from non-science. However, there is a set of core principles that make up the “bones” of scientific research. These principles are widely accepted within the scientific community. Although there is no fixed set of steps that scientists always follow during an investigation, and there is no single path that leads scientists to knowledge, there are certain features of science that give it a distinct way of investigating.





Scientific Methods


Scientific investigations examine, gain new knowledge, or build on previous knowledge about phenomena. A phenomenon , is any occurrence that is observable. It can be simply a burning match shown in the Figure below , as well as the structure of a cell and the prey of a lion. A phenomenon may be a feature of matter, energy, or time. For example, Isaac Newton made observations of the phenomenon of the moon's orbit, Galileo Galilei made observations of phenomena related to swinging pendulums and Charles Darwin made observations of unique plant and animal species. Although procedures vary from one field of scientific inquiry to another, certain features distinguish scientific inquiry from other types of knowledge. Scientific methods are based on gathering observable, empirical (produced by experiment or observation), and measurable evidence that is critically evaluated.



Figure 2.4

The combustion of this match is an observable event and therefore a phenomenon.

Scientific Investigations


The scientific method is not a step by step, linear process. It is a way of learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists must be able to have an idea of what the answer to an investigation should be. In order for scientists to make educated guesses about the answers, they will base their guesses on previous knowledge, with the notion of extending that knowledge. Scientists will often make an observation and then form a hypothesis to explain why a phenomenon occurred. They use all of their knowledge and a bit of imagination in their journey of discovery.

A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a question or problem, based on evidence that can be tested by observation or experimentation. A hypothesis absolutely must be testable-- it gains credibility by being tested over and over again, and by surviving attempts to prove it wrong. Scientists may test and reject several hypotheses before solving a problem.

Scientific investigations involve the collection of data through observation, the formation and testing of hypotheses by experimentation, and analysis of the results that involves reasoning. Scientific investigations begin with observations that lead to questions.

We will use an everyday example to show what makes up a scientific investigation. Imagine that you walk into a room, and the room is dark.

You observe that the room appears dark, and you question why the room is dark.

In an attempt to find explanations to this phenomenon, you develop several different hypotheses. One hypothesis might be that the room does not have a light source at all. Another hypothesis might be that the lights are turned off. Still, another might be that the light bulb has burnt out. Worse yet, you could be going blind.

To discover the answer, you experiment. You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on. No light. You repeat the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth; still nothing.

This means your first two hypotheses, that the room is dark because (1) it does not have a light source; and (2) the lights are off, have been disproved.

You think of more experiments to test your hypotheses, such as switching on a flashlight to prove that you are not blind.

In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the answer, you could predict that changing the light bulb will fix the problem. If your predictions about this hypothesis succeed (changing the light bulb fixes the problem), the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted.

However, in some cases, your predictions will not succeed (changing the light bulb does not fix the problem), and you will have to start over again with a new hypothesis. Perhaps there is a short circuit somewhere in the house, or the power might be out.



The general process of a scientific investigation is summed up in Figure below .



Figure 2.5

The general pathway of a scientific investigation. A scientific investigation typically has these steps, though the pathway is often modified for a specific scientific investigation.





Figure 2.6

The general process of scientific investigations. This diagram illustrates how scientific investigations move from observation of phenomenon to a theory. The progress is not as straightforward as it looks in this diagram. Many times the hypothesis is falsified, which means the investigator will have to redevelop/revise a hypothesis.

Making Observations


Scientists first make observations that raise questions. An observation is the act of noting or detecting phenomenon through the senses. For example, noting that a room is dark is an observation made through sight.





Developing Hypotheses


In order to explain the observed phenomenon, scientists develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for a phenomenon or a suggested explanation for a relationship between many phenomena. Hypotheses are always based on evidence that can be tested by observation or experimentation. Scientific investigations are required to test hypotheses. Scientists mostly base hypotheses on prior observations or on extensions of existing scientific explanations.

Though many people describe a hypothesis as an "educated guess," that definition is not scientifically accurate. To define a hypothesis as "an educated guess" is like calling a tricycle a "vehicle with three." This definition of a tricycle leaves out its most important and characteristic feature: its wheels. The "educated guess" definition of a hypothesis also leaves out the concept's most important and characteristic feature: the purpose of the hypotheses. People generate hypotheses as early attempts to explain patterns observed in nature or to predict the outcomes of experiments. For example, in science, one could correctly call the following statement a hypothesis: identical twins can have different personalities because environment influences personality.





Evaluating Hypotheses


Scientific methods require hypotheses that are falsifiable , that is, they must be framed in a way that allows other scientists to prove them false. Proving a hypothesis to be false is usually done by observation and experimentation. However, confirming or failing to falsify a hypothesis does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is true.

For example, a person comes to a new country and observes only white sheep. This person might form the hypothesis: “All sheep in this country are white.” This statement can be called a hypothesis, because it is falsifiable - it can be tested and proved wrong; anyone could falsify the hypothesis by observing a single black sheep, shown in Figure below . If the experimental uncertainties remain small (could the person reliably distinguish the observed black sheep from a goat or a small horse), and if the experimenter has correctly interpreted the hypothesis, finding a black sheep falsifies the "only white sheep" hypothesis. However, you cannot call a failure to find non-white sheep as proof that no non-white sheep exist.



Figure 2.7

The statement “there are only white sheep in this country” is a hypothesis because it is open to being falsified. However, failure to see a black sheep does not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. A better scientific hypothesis may be that "only white sheep can survive in this country because of the existing ecosystems."

Scientific Reasoning - Advanced


Outline the role that reasoning plays in examining hypotheses.

Define and compare inductive and deductive reasoning.





What does it mean to reason ?

"What does the data show? Did the experiment work? Is the hypothesis correct?" Reasoning is the human process used to make sense of things. Reasoning is also used to establish and verify facts. "Scientific reasoning" is no different than everyday reasoning - it is used to make sense of things related to the scientific process, such as conclusions based on the results of an experiment.





Scientific Reasoning


Any useful hypothesis will allow predictions based on reasoning. Reasoning can be broken down into two categories: deduction and induction. Most reasoning in science is done through induction.





Deductive Reasoning: Deduction


Deduction involves determining a single fact from a general statement; it is only as accurate as the statement.

For example, we know that all organisms are made of cells and need to maintain homeostasis and must reproduce to stay alive. Therefore, since humans are organisms, we can then deduce that humans are made of cells, maintain homeostasis and reproduce.

Deductions are based on valid reasoning. The reasoning in the following argument is valid, because there is no way in which the reasons 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false:

Reason 1: All humans are mortal.

Reason 2: Albert Einstein is a human.

Conclusion: Albert Einstein is mortal ( Figure below ).





Figure 2.8

Albert Einstein (1879–1955) Deductive reasoning has helped us determine that Albert Einstein is a mortal being.





Inductive Reasoning: Induction


Induction involves determining a general statement that is very likely to be true from several facts.

For example, if we have had a test every Tuesday for the past three months, we will have a test next Tuesday (and every Tuesday after that).

Induction contrasts strongly with deduction. Even in the best, strongest cases of induction, the truth of the reason does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument is very likely to be true, but you cannot be fully sure it is true because you are making a prediction about a fact that has yet to be proven.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the philosopher David Hume:

Reason: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.

Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.



Inductive reasoning involves reaching conclusions about unobserved things on the basis of what has already been observed. Induction is used regularly in fields such as archaeology, where inferences about the past from present are made. Inductions could also be made across outer space, as in astronomy, where conclusions about the whole universe are drawn from the limited number of observations we are able to make.





Vocabulary


deduction : Involves determining a single fact from a general statement.

induction : Involves determining a general statement that is very likely to be true, from several facts; the relief of repression for a gene or set of genes under negative control.





Summary


Any useful hypothesis will allow predictions based on reasoning. Reasoning can be broken down into two categories: deduction and induction. Most reasoning in science is formed through induction.

Experiments - Advanced


Describe what defines a scientific experiment.

Examine the function of the control, dependent and independent variables in an experiment.

Explain Occam’s razor.

Describe experiments without controls.

Compare natural to field experiments.

Discuss the importance of a scientist communicating results.





So what exactly is an experiment?

Observing lions in their natural habitat. Analyzing DNA for mutations to a particular disease, such as Tay-Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis. Studying the species of the Galápagos Islands. Are these all experiments? Do all experiments have to be done in a laboratory? The answers to these questions are yes and no. No, experiments do not have to be done in a laboratory, but yes, observing lions in their natural habitat, analyzing DNA for mutations, and studying the species of the Galápagos Islands can all be considered experiments. A common characteristic of experiments involves trying to answer specific questions posed based on a hypothesis.





Experiments


An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. A scientific experiment must have all of the following features:

a control, so variables that could affect the outcome are reduced,

the variable being tested reflects the phenomenon being studied,

the variable being tested can be measured accurately, to avoid experimental error,

the experiment must be reproducible.



The experiment is a cornerstone in the scientific approach to gaining deeper knowledge about the natural world. Scientists use the principles of their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test them to see if their predictions are to be confirmed or rejected.



Figure 2.9

A laboratory experiment studying plant growth. What might this experiment involve?



Scientific experiments involve controls , or subjects that are not tested during the investigation. In this way, a scientist limits the factors, or variables that can cause the results of an investigation to differ. A variable is a factor that can change over the course of an experiment. Independent variables are factors whose values are controlled by the experimenter to determine their relationship with an observed phenomenon. Dependent variables are the observed phenomenon, and change in response to the independent variable. Controlled variables are also important to identify in experiments. They are the variables that are kept constant to prevent them from influencing the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable.

For example, if you were to measure the effect that different amounts of fertilizer has on plant growth, the independent variable would be the amount of fertilizer used (the changing factor of the experiment). The dependent variables would be the growth in height and/or mass of the plant (the factors that are influenced in the experiment). The controlled variables include the type of plant, the type of fertilizer, the amount of sunlight the plant gets, the size of the pots you use. The controlled variables are controlled by you, otherwise they would influence the dependent variable.

In summary:

The independent variable answers the question, "What do I change?"

The dependent variables answer the question, "What do I observe?"

The controlled variables answer the question, "What do I keep the same?"





Experimental Design


Controlled Experiments


In an old joke, a person claims that they are snapping their fingers "to keep tigers away," and justifies their behavior by saying, "See, it works!" While this experiment does not falsify the hypothesis that "snapping your fingers keeps tigers away," it does not support the hypothesis either because not snapping your fingers will also keep tigers away. It also follows that not snapping your fingers will not cause tigers to suddenly appear ( Figure below ).



Figure 2.10

Are tigers really scared of snapping fingers, or is it more likely they are just not found in your neighborhood? Considering which of the hypotheses is more likely to be true can help you arrive at a valid answer. This principle, called Occam’s razor states that the explanation for a phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible. In this case, the hypothesis “there are no tigers in my neighborhood to begin with” is more likely, because it makes the least number of assumptions about the situation.



To demonstrate a cause and effect hypothesis, an experiment must often show that, for example, a phenomenon occurs after a certain treatment is given to a subject, and that the phenomenon does not occur in the absence of the treatment.

One way to test a cause and effect hypothesis is to perform a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, two identical experiments are carried out side-by-side. In one of the experiments, the independent variable being tested is used, and in the other experiment, the control, the independent variable is not used.

A controlled experiment generally compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample. The control sample is almost identical to the experimental sample except for the one variable whose effect is being tested. A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group, and the group receiving the placebo would be the control. A placebo is a form of medicine that does not contain the drug that is being tested.

Controlled experiments can still be conducted when it is difficult to exert complete control over all the conditions in an experiment. In this case, the experiment begins by creating two or more sample groups that are similar in as many ways as possible, which means that both groups should respond in the same way if given the same treatment.

Once the groups have been formed, the experimenter tries to treat them identically except for the one variable that he or she wants to study (the independent variable). Usually, neither the patients nor the doctor knows which group receives the real drug. This type of experiment is called a double blind experiment , which serves to isolate the effects of the drug and allow the researchers to be sure the drug does work, and that the effects seen in the patients are not due to the patients believing they are getting better.

Controlled experiments can be carried out on many subjects other than people; some are even carried out in space. The wheat plants in Figure below are being grown in the International Space Station to study the effects of microgravity on plant growth. Researchers hope to one day be able to grow enough plants during spaceflight to feed hungry astronauts and cosmonauts. The investigation also measured the amount of oxygen the plants can produce in the hope that plants could become a cheap and effective way to provide oxygen during space travel.



Figure 2.11

Spaceflight participant Anousheh Ansari holds a miniature wheat plant grown in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.





Experiments Without Controls


The term experiment usually refers to a controlled experiment, but sometimes, it is difficult or impossible to completely control experiments. In this case, researchers carry out natural experiments. When scientists conduct a study in nature instead of the more controlled environment of a lab setting, they cannot control variables such as sunlight, temperature, or moisture. Natural experiments therefore depend on the scientist’s observations of the system under study, rather than the observations of just one or a few variables as in controlled experiments.

In natural experiments, researchers attempt to collect data as consistently as possible. They attempt to ensure that the effects of the variation remains fairly constant so that the effects of other factors can be determined. Natural experiments are a common research tool in areas of study where controlled experiments are difficult to carry out. Examples include:

astronomy - the study of stars, planets, comets, galaxies and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere,

paleontology - the study of prehistoric life forms through the examination of fossils, and

meteorology - the study of Earth’s atmosphere.



In astronomy it is impossible, when testing the hypothesis "suns are collapsed clouds of hydrogen", to start out with a giant cloud of hydrogen, and then carry out the experiment of waiting a few billion years for it to form a sun. However, by observing various clouds of hydrogen in various states of collapse and other phenomena related to the hypothesis such as the nebula shown in Figure below , researchers can collect the data they need to support (or maybe falsify) the hypothesis.

An early example of this type of experiment was the first verification in the 1600s that light does not travel from place to place instantaneously, but instead has a speed that can be measured. Observation of the appearance of the moons of Jupiter were slightly delayed when Jupiter was farther from Earth, as opposed to when Jupiter was closer to Earth. This phenomenon was used to demonstrate that the difference in the time of appearance of the moons was consistent with a measurable speed of light.



Figure 2.12

The Helix nebula, located about 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius, belongs to a class of objects called planetary nebulae . Planetary nebulae are the remains of stars that once looked a lot like our sun. When sun-like stars die, they puff out their outer gaseous layers. These layers are heated by the hot core of the dead star, called a white dwarf, and shine with infrared and visible colors. Scientists can study the birth and death of stars by analyzing the types of light that are emitted from nebulae.





Natural Experiments


There are situations where it would be wrong or harmful to carry out an experiment. In these cases, scientists carry out a natural experiment, or an investigation without an experiment. For example, alcohol can cause developmental defects in fetuses, leading to mental and physical problems, through a condition called fetal alcohol syndrome.

Certain researchers want to study the effects of alcohol on fetal development, but it would be considered wrong or unethical to ask a group of pregnant women to drink alcohol to study its effects on their children. Instead, researchers carry out a natural experiment in which they study data that is gathered from mothers of children with fetal alcohol syndrome, or pregnant women who continue to drink alcohol during pregnancy. The researchers will try to reduce the number of variables in the study (such as the amount or type of alcohol consumed), which might affect their data. It is important to note that the researchers do not influence or encourage the consumption of alcohol; they collect this information from volunteers.





Field Experiments


Field experiments are so named to distinguish them from lab experiments. Field experiments have the advantage that observations are made in a natural setting rather than in a human-made laboratory environment. However, like natural experiments, field experiments can become contaminated, and conditions like the weather are not easy to control. Experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab.

Predictions


A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under specific conditions. It can be expressed in the form: If A is true, then B will also be true. Predictions are based on confirmed hypotheses shown to be true or not proved to be false.

For researchers to be confident that their predictions will be useful and descriptive, their data must have as few errors as possible. Accuracy is the measure of how close a calculated or measured quantity is to its actual value. Accuracy is closely related to precision , also called reproducibility or repeatability, which is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. The reproducibility and repeatability of experiments are cornerstones of scientific methods. If no other researcher can reproduce or repeat the results of a certain study, then the results of the study will not be accepted as valid. Results are considered valid only if they are both accurate and precise.

A useful tool to help explain the difference between accuracy and precision is a target, shown in Figure below . In this analogy, repeated measurements are the arrows that are fired at a target. Accuracy describes the closeness of arrows to the bulls eye at the center. Arrows that hit closer to the bulls eye are more accurate. Arrows that are grouped together more tightly are more precise.



Figure 2.13

A visual analogy of accuracy and precision. Left target: High accuracy but low precision; Right target: low accuracy but high precision. The results of calculations or a measurement can be accurate but not precise; precise but not accurate; neither accurate nor precise; or accurate and precise. A collection of bulls eyes right around the center of the target would be both accurate and precise.





Experimental Error


An error is a boundary on the precision and accuracy of the result of a measurement. Some errors are caused by unpredictable changes in the measuring devices (such as balances, rulers, or calipers), but other errors can be caused by reading a measuring device incorrectly or by using broken or malfunctioning equipment. Such errors can have an impact on the reliability of the experiment’s results; they affect the accuracy of measurements. For example, you use a balance to obtain the mass of a 100 gram block. Three measurements that you get are: 93.1 g, 92.0 g, and 91.8 g. The measurements are precise, as they are close together, but they are not accurate.

If the cause of the error can be identified, then it can usually be eliminated or minimized. Reducing the number of possible errors by careful measurement and using a large enough sample size to reduce the effect of errors will improve the reliability of your results.





Drawing Conclusions


After experiments have been performed, the results must be analyzed. The data should either agree or disagree with your hypothesis. Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, the process moves forward and the scientist begins to think about the next steps. If the data does not support the hypothesis, the hypothesis may need to be altered.

Does evidence that supports the hypothesis prove that your hypothesis is true? No, not necessarily. A hypothesis cannot be proven conclusively to be true. This is because you can never examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be found that disproves the hypothesis. Nonetheless, the more evidence that supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true.





Communicating Results


The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you have learned with others. This is a very important step because it allows others to test your hypothesis. If other researchers get the same results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis. However, if they get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis. When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods and point out any possible problems with the investigation. Results can be communicated in various ways. A scientist usually contributes material through publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Peer-review ensures the material is of an acceptable quality for the scientific community. Scientists also write review articles, book chapters, and even whole books. They also regularly participate in scientific meetings, presenting their material in front of large audiences of their peers.





Vocabulary


accuracy : The measure of how close a calculated or measured quantity is to its actual value.

Scientific Theories - Advanced


Define what is meant by a scientific theory and compare this to the meaning of a hypothesis.

Give examples of scientific theories.

Explain and describe a superseded theory.

Compare scientific theories to scientific laws.





Theory vs. theory. Is a scientific theory different from the everyday use of the word theory?

The Big Bang Theory. The Theory of Gravity. The Plate Tectonic Theory. The Modern Atomic Theory. The Cell Theory. The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. These are all classic scientific theories. So, without a doubt, yes, a scientific theory is very different from the everyday use of the word theory. A scientific theory is accepted as a scientific truth, supported by evidence collected by many scientists. Lots of data has been collected to support theories, and no data has been identified to prove theories incorrect. That does not necessarily mean that evidence does not exist against a theory does not exist, it simply means that evidence has yet to be identified.





Scientific Theories


Scientific theories are hypotheses which have stood up to repeated attempts at falsification and are thus supported by a great deal of data and evidence. Some well known biological theories include the theory of evolution by natural selection, the cell theory (the idea that all organisms are made of cells), and the germ theory of disease (the idea that certain microbes cause certain diseases). The scientific community holds that a greater amount of evidence supports these ideas than contradicts them, and so they are referred to as theories. In fact, no evidence has been identified to disprove these or other scientific theories.

In every day use, people often use the word theory to describe a guess or an opinion. For example, “I have a theory as to why the light bulb is not working.” When used in this common way, “theory” does not have to be based on facts. It does not have to be based on a true description of reality. This usage of the word theory often leads to a misconception that can be best summed up by the phrase, "It's not a fact, it's only a theory." In such everyday usage, the word is most similar to the term hypothesis.

Scientific theories are the equivalent of what in everyday speech we would refer to as facts . In principle, scientific theories are always subject to corrections or inclusion in another, wider theory. As a general rule for use of the term, theories tend to deal with broader sets of phenomena than do hypotheses, which usually deal with much more specific sets of phenomena or specific applications of a theory.

A video discussing the difference between a hypothesis and a theory can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdWMcMW54fA (6:39).

Constructing Theories


In time, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or may grow to become a theory itself. Scientific hypotheses may be mathematical models. Sometimes they can be statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations. These theories have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

A hypothesis may predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory or the observation of a natural phenomenon. A hypothesis should also be falsifiable, and one cannot regard a hypothesis or a theory as scientific if it does not lend itself to being falsified, even in the future. To meet the “falsifiable” requirement, it must at least in principle be possible to make an observation that would disprove the hypothesis. A falsifiable hypothesis can greatly simplify the process of testing to determine whether the hypothesis can be proven to be false. Scientific methods rely heavily on the falsifiability of hypotheses by experimentation and observation in order to answer questions. Philosopher Karl Popper suggested that all scientific theories should be falsifiable, or otherwise they could not be tested by experiment.

A scientific theory must meet the following requirements:

it must be consistent with a pre-existing theory. The pre-existing theory must have been experimentally verified, though it may often show a pre-existing theory to be wrong in an exact sense,

it must be supported by many strands of evidence rather than a single foundation, ensuring that it is a good approximation or even completely correct.



Also, a theory is generally only taken seriously if it:

allows for changes to be made as new data is discovered, rather than claiming absolute certainty,

is the most straight forward explanation, and makes the fewest assumptions about a phenomenon (commonly called “passing the Occam's razor test”).



This is true of such established theories as those of special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, and evolution. Theories considered scientific ideally meet all of these extra criteria as well.

In summary, to meet the status of a scientific theory, the theory must be falsifiable or testable. Examples of scientific theories in different areas of science include:

Astronomy : Big Bang Theory

Biology : Cell Theory; Theory of Evolution; Germ Theory of Disease

Chemistry : Atomic Theory; Kinetic Theory of Gases

Physics : General Relativity; Special Relativity; Theory of Relativity; Quantum Field Theory

Earth Science : Giant Impact Theory; Plate Tectonics





Unverifiable Theories


The term theory is sometimes stretched to refer to theoretical speculation which is currently unverifiable. A couple examples of such uses include string theory and the theory of everything. String theory is a model of physics, which predicts the existence of many more dimensions in the universe than the four dimensions that current science understands (length, width, height, and space-time). The theory of everything is a hypothetical theory in physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena.

For a scientific theory to be valid, it must be verified experimentally. Many parts of the string theory are currently untestable due to the large amount of energy that would be needed to carry out the necessary experiments as well as the high cost of conducting these experiments. Therefore string theory may not be tested in the foreseeable future. Some scientists have even questioned whether it deserves to be called a scientific theory because it is not falsifiable.





Superseded Theories


A superseded theory , or obsolete scientific theory is a theory that was once commonly accepted, but for a given reason is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science. It can also refer to a falsifiable theory which has been shown to be false. Giraffes, shown in Figure below , are often used in the explanation of Lamarck's superseded theory of evolution. In Lamarckism, a giraffe lengthens its neck over the course of its life in order to, for example, reach higher leaves. That giraffe will then have offspring with longer necks. The theory has been superseded by the understanding of natural selection on populations of organisms as the main means of evolution (Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection), not physical changes to a single organism over its lifetime.



Figure 2.14

Superseded theories like Lamarck’s theory of evolution are theories that are now considered obsolete and have been replaced by newer theories that have more evidence to support them. In Lamarck’s case, his theory was replaced by Darwin’s theory of evolution and natural selection, which will be further discussed in additional concepts.





Scientific Laws


Scientific laws are similar to scientific theories, in that they are principles which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world. Both scientific laws and scientific theories are typically well-supported by observations and/or experimental evidence. Usually scientific laws provide rules for how nature will behave under certain conditions. Scientific theories are more overarching explanations of how nature works and why it exhibits certain characteristics.

A physical law or law of nature is a scientific generalization based on a sufficiently large number of empirical observations, so that it is accepted as fully verified.

Isaac Newton's law of gravitation is a famous example of an established law that was later found not to be universal—it does not hold in experiments involving motion at speeds close to the speed of light or in close proximity of strong gravitational fields. However, outside these conditions, Newton's laws remain an excellent model of motion and gravity.

Scientists never claim absolute knowledge of nature or the behavior of the subject of the field of study. A scientific theory is always open to falsification, if new evidence is presented. Even the most basic and fundamental theories may turn out to be imperfect if new observations are inconsistent with them. It is critical to make every relevant part of research publicly available. This allows for and encourages peer review of published results, and it also allows ongoing reviews, repetition of experiments and observations by many different researchers. Only by meeting these expectations can it be determined how reliable the experimental results are for possible use by others.





Vocabulary


law of nature : A scientific generalization based on a sufficiently large number of empirical observations so that it is taken as fully verified; physical law.

physical law : A scientific generalization based on a sufficiently large number of empirical observations so that it is taken as fully verified; law of nature.

scientific law : A principle which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world.

scientific theory : A hypothesis which has stood up to repeated attempts at falsification; supported by a great deal of data and evidence.

superseded theory : A theory that was once commonly accepted, but is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science.





Summary


Scientific theories are hypotheses which have stood up to repeated attempts at falsification and are thus supported by much data and evidence.

Scientific laws are similar to scientific theories in that they are principles which can be used to predict the behavior of the natural world.

A scientific theory must be supported by many strands of evidence rather than a single foundation, ensuring that it is probably a good approximation, if not totally correct.

A superseded scientific theory is a theory that was once commonly accepted, but is no longer considered the most complete description of reality by mainstream science.

Scientific Models - Advanced


Outline the importance of scientific models.

Describe factors important in evaluating models.

List common model organisms.





What is a scientific model?

Looks like a human head, but it is obviously missing certain parts. Of course, this would be a model, and it could be considered a scientific model as it represents the anatomy of the head and skull. It can be used to teach about this anatomy.





Scientific Models


To describe particular parts of a phenomenon, or the interactions among a set of phenomena, it is sometimes helpful to develop a model of the phenomenon. Scientific models are representations of reality. They can be a physical, mathematical, or logical representations of a system, phenomenon, or process, and they allow scientists to investigate a phenomenon in a controlled way. For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system. The parts of an actual house or an actual solar system represented by a scale model are, only in limited ways, representative of the actual objects ( Figure below ).



Figure 2.15

A model of planets of the solar system. This model is clearly not a real solar system; it is a representation of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Scientists use representations of natural things to learn more about them. Also, the visitors to the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California can get a better idea of the relative sizes of the planets by observing this model.



Scientific modeling is the process of making abstract models of natural phenomena. An abstract model is a theoretical construct that represents something. Models are developed to allow reasoning within a simplified framework that is similar to the phenomena being investigated. The simplified model may assume certain things that are known to be incomplete in some details. Such assumptions can be useful in that they simplify the model, while at the same time, allowing the development of acceptably accurate solutions. These models play an important role in developing scientific theories.

A simulation is a model that runs over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. It is useful for testing, analysis or training where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by a model. For the scientist, a model also provides a way for calculations to be expanded to explore what might happen in different situations. This method often takes the form of models that can be programmed into computers. The scientist controls the basic assumptions about the variables in the model, and the computer runs the simulation, eventually coming to a complex answer.

Examples of models include:

Computer models

Weather forecast models

Molecular models

Climate models

Ecosystem models

Geologic models



One of the main aims of scientific modeling is to allow researchers to quantify their observations about the world. In this way, researchers hope to see new things that may have escaped the notice of other researchers. There are many techniques that model builders use which allow us to discover things about a phenomenon that may not be obvious to everyone. The National Weather Service Enhanced Radar Images web site ( http://radar.weather.gov/ ) is an excellent example of a simulation. The site exhibits current weather forecasts across the United States.



Figure 2.16

These two food chains represent the flow of energy in complex systems in nature. These conceptual models make the systems easier to understand. Models of very complex systems are often based on mathematical equations or computer simulations.





Evaluating Models


A person who develops a model must be able to recognize whether a model reflects reality. They must also be able to identify and work with differences between actual data and theory.

A model is evaluated mostly by how it reflects past observations of the phenomenon. Any model that is not consistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. However, a fit to observed data alone is not enough for a model to be accepted as valid. Other factors important in evaluating a model include:

its ability to explain past observations,

its ability to predict future observations,

its ability to control events,

the cost of its use, especially when used with other models,

ease of use and how it looks.



Some examples of the different types of models that are used by science are shown in Figures below and below .



Figure 2.17

A computer model of wind patterns across the continental United States for 21 June, 2013. This model is used to forecast wind speeds and directions. Data on wind speed, direction, and related data are entered into a computer which then produces this simulation. This visual model is much easier for a person to understand than a large table of numbers.





Figure 2.18

Biosphere 2 is an example of a very large three-dimensional model which biologists built to attempt to recreate a self-sustaining biome. To learn more about biomes and ecosystems, see Concept Ecology (Advanced) .





Theories as Models


Scientific theories are constructed in order to explain, predict, and understand phenomena. This could include explanations for the movement of planets, weather patterns, or the behavior of animals. In many instances we are constructing models of reality. A theory makes generalizations about observations and is made up of a related set of ideas and models. The important difference between theories and models is that the first is explanatory as well as descriptive, while the second is only descriptive and predictive in a much more limited sense.





Model Organisms


A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological processes and concepts. These organisms are chosen because it is believed that discoveries made in the model organism will provide insight into the workings of other organisms, including humans. Model organisms range from single-celled bacteria to complex multi-cellular organisms. Even some viruses are utilized as models, though technically a virus is not considered an organism.

The Table below lists some common model organisms. All of these organisms listed have had their complete genomes sequenced.

What is a scientist?

It could be said that a scientist is someone who uses a systematic approach to acquire new knowledge. A scientist can also be defined as someone who uses the scientific method. A scientist may be an expert in one or more areas of science, such as biology, or more specifically biochemistry, genetics or ecology. Regardless of the specialty of the scientist, a common factor that unites all scientists is that they perform research to work towards a more comprehensive understanding of nature.





What Is a Scientist?


Science and Society


Biology literally means "the study of life." It is also a science that is consistently used in our everyday lives. Biology is a very broad field, covering topics from the intricate workings of chemical processes inside our cells, to the more broad concepts of ecosystems and global climate change. Biologists study minute details of the human brain, the make up of our genes, and even the functioning of our reproductive system. For example, biologists recently finished decoding the human genome, the sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases that may determine much of our abilities and predispositions for certain illnesses and can also play a major role in many court cases. For example, criminals have been caught, victims identified, and wrongly imprisoned people have been freed based on DNA evidence.

We are constantly being blitzed with headlines about possible health risks from certain foods as well as possible benefits of eating other foods. Commercials try to sell us the latest “miracle” pill for easy, fast weight loss. Most people may choose the conventional medications that can be bought at the pharmacy. However, many people are turning to herbal remedies to ease arthritis pain, improve memory, as well as improve their mood. It is important to know the effects that such supplements, such as the ones shown in Figure below , and medications can have on the body.



Figure 2.19

Nutritional supplements. Understanding how your body works and how nutrients work will help you decide whether you need to take a nutritional supplement. It will also help you make sense of the large amount of information available about regular medicines, if and when you need to take them.



Can just one biology course give you the answers to these everyday questions? No, but it can assist you in learning how to sift through the biases of investigators, the press, and others in a quest to critically evaluate the question. It is doubtful you would remember all the details of metabolism, neither are they necessarily very pertinent. However, in participating in a biology course, you will learn to become a critical thinker. Knowing about the process of science will also allow you to make a more informed decision. Will you be a scientist? Yes, in a way. You may not be formally trained as a scientist, but you will be able to think critically, solve problems, have some idea about what science can and cannot do, and you will also have an understanding of the role of biology in your everyday life.





Biology and You


So why should you study biology? Because you are surrounded by it every day! It is about what happens in your brain as you read the words on this page, and about how hippopotamuses know to come up to the surface to breathe even while sleeping. Biology covers topics from the reason why a person with hook worms doesn't sneeze as much, to why Velcro works. From understanding the benefits of the vitamin-enriched milk or juice that you have at breakfast, to discerning commercials that promise a fuller head of hair, to snack foods that announce they are the "healthier option for you," you cannot be fully informed about such claims unless you understand the science behind them, or can think like a scientist to analyze them. For example, you would need to know the types of fats you need to get from your food to know why eating salmon, or other foods such as flax seeds and kiwi fruit may be good for your health.



Figure 2.20

Salmon has recently been touted as “super-brain food,” but do you know why it is so good for you? Educating yourself on how science affects your life is important. It will help you better analyze the validity of such claims, help you take better care of your health, and be a wiser healthcare consumer.



You may also become a stronger advocate for your community. For example, if a tree planting initiative has begun in your neighborhood, you can investigate the plan for your area and find out what you can do. You could then explain what the program is about to your friends and family.

Or, perhaps a city park has fallen into disrepair, and city officials are looking for feedback from the public about what to do with it. You could use scientific thinking to analyze the issue and options, and develop possible solutions.





What Is a Scientist?


What exactly makes a person a scientist and what is their role in society? First, we should start with what scientists are not. They are not crazed geniuses with bad hair and a fondness for hysterical laughter, as the Figure below might suggest. Although they may not be on the cutting edge of fashion, they are regular people. They went to school like you, they studied math, reading, and science like you, and they probably exhibited at science fairs, just like the students in the Figure below .



Figure 2.21

Spot the Scientist. (a) An example of what scientists are not. (b) Real-life young scientists at an exhibition where they are presenting their research.



Being a scientist does not require you to learn everything in these over 500 concepts or any other science book by heart, but understanding the important concepts does helps. Instead, being a scientist begins by thinking like a scientist. Scientists are curious about how the world works; they have many questions and go about answering those questions using the scientific methods.

If you are fascinated by how things work and why they work a certain way, you too could become a scientist! Research scientists are the people that do the investigations and make the discoveries that you read or hear about. To work as a research scientist, a person usually needs an advanced degree in science. An advanced degree is obtained by attending graduate school after getting a Bachelor of Science, Engineering, or Arts degree. A Bachelor degree normally takes four years to complete, a graduate Masters degrees usually take two years and a graduate Doctorate degree takes four or more years to complete.

Scientific research offers much more to a person than just discovering new things. Researchers have the opportunity to meet with other people (scientists and non-scientists) who care about the same subjects that the scientists research such as cancer research, marine ecology, or human nutrition. Many researchers also teach students who will become the next generation of scientists. Scientists have many opportunities to work with different people, explore new fields, and broaden their expertise.

Scientists are part of a community that is based on ideals of trust and freedom, and their work can have a direct effect on society. As a result, the public usually has an interest in the results of research that will directly affect them. Therefore it is important that you can understand the meaning of a story about science when you read it, see it, or hear about it and become an engaged and active member of the public when making decisions involving science.

Science As a Human Endeavor


Conducting science requires part human creativity and part scientific skepticism. Researchers make new observations and develop new ideas with the aim of describing the world more accurately or completely. These observations and ideas are often based on existing theories and observations that were made by earlier scientists.

The history of molecular biology , for example, is the study of molecules that make up living things, and is a good example of how scientific knowledge builds on earlier knowledge.

Researchers from chemistry and physics were involved in the early investigations to discover what was responsible for heredity. Scientists in the late 19 th and early 20 th century knew that organisms inherited certain characteristics such as hair color from their parents. What we now call "genes" were then called “units of heredity.” However at the time, scientists did not know exactly how these heredity units were inherited or what they were made of. Following the development of the Mendelian theory of heredity in the 1910s and the development of atomic theory and quantum mechanics in the 1920s, such explanations began to seem within reach. Researchers from chemistry and physics turned their attention to this biological question. Still, in the 1930s and 1940s it was not clear which, if any, area of research would be most successful.

In 1940, geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum demonstrated a relationship between genes and proteins. In 1944, physician and researcher Oswald Avery further elaborated on that finding by demonstrating that genes are made up of DNA. In 1952, geneticist Alfred Hershey and lab assistant Martha Chase confirmed that the genetic material of a virus that infects bacteria is made up of DNA. And in 1953, biologist James Watson and biophysicist Francis Crick, with the help of X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin, worked out the three dimensional structure of DNA and built a model of the double helix structure of the molecule.

There have been many additional discoveries about DNA and heredity since then, which will be discussed in additional concepts.





Influences on Scientific Research


To nonscientists, the competition, frustration, cooperation, and disagreement between research scientists can seem disorganized. Scientific knowledge develops from humans trying to figure things out. Scientific research and discoveries are carried out by people—people who have virtues, values, shortcomings, and limitations—just like everyone else. As a result, science and research can be influenced by the values of the society in which the research is carried out. How do such values influence research?

This question is of interest to more than just the scientific community. Science is becoming a larger part of everyone’s life, from developing more effective medicines, to developing more productive crops, and to designing innovative air conditioning systems that are modeled after the self-cooling nests of termites. The public has become more interested in learning more about the areas of science that affect everyday life. As a result, scientists have become more accountable to a society that expects to benefit from their work.

It costs money to carry out scientific studies. Things such as the cost of equipment, transportation, rent, and salaries for the people carrying out the research all need to be considered before a study can begin. The systems of financial support for scientists and their work have been important influences of the type of research and the pace of how that research is conducted. Today, funding for research comes from many different sources, some of which include:

government, for example, through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),

military funding, such as through the Department of Defense,

corporate sponsorship,

non-profit organizations, such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association,

private donors.



When the economy of a country slows down, the amount of money available for funding research is usually reduced, because both governments and businesses try to save funds by reducing certain non-essential expenses.

Many pharmaceutical companies are heavily invested in research and development, on which they spend many millions of dollars every year. The companies aim to research and develop drugs that can be marketed and sold to treat certain illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease. Areas of research in which the companies do not see any hope of a return on their huge investments are not likely to be studied.

For example, two researchers, Evangelos Michelakis and Steven Archer of the University of Alberta, Canada, recently reported that a drug that has been used for in the treatment of rare metabolic disorders could be an effective drug for the treatment of several forms of cancer. Dichloroacetic acid, (DCA), is a chemical compound that appears to change the way cancer cells get energy, without affecting the function of normal cells. The researchers found that DCA killed cancer cells that were grown in the lab and reduced the size of tumors in rats.

However, DCA is non-patentable as a compound. A patent is a set of rights granted to a person or company (the patentee) for a certain period of time which allows the patentee the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or offer to sell the patented item. Because DCA cannot currently be patented, concerns are raised that without the financial security a patent would ensure, the financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to get involved in DCA-cancer research would be reduced, and therefore clinical trials of DCA may not be funded.

But, other sources of funding exist-- previous studies of DCA have been funded by government organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by private charities such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Recognizing the possible challenges to funding, Dr. Michelakis's lab took the unusual step of directly asking for online donations to fund the research. After six months, his lab had raised over $800,000, which was enough to fund a small clinical study. Dr. Michelakis and Dr. Archer have since applied for a patent on the use of DCA in the treatment of cancer.

Funding for research can also be influenced by the public and by social issues. An intense amount of public interest was raised by the DCA study. The story received much media attention in early 2007. As a result, the American Cancer Society and other medical organizations received a large volume of public interest and questions regarding DCA. A few months later, the Department of Medicine of Alberta University reported that after the trial funding was secured, both the Alberta local ethics committee and Health Canada approved the first DCA Clinical Trial in Cancer.

Government funding of research can be indirectly influenced by the public. Funding priorities for specific research can be influenced by the ethical beliefs or reservations of elected public officials, or influenced by the public during constitutional amendment elections. Celebrities often campaign to bring public attention to issues that are important to them.





Science and Ethics


Ethics , also called moral philosophy, is the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad, right and wrong. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles. Personal ethics is the moral code that a person adheres to, while social ethics includes the moral theory that is applied to groups. Bioethics is the social ethics of biology and medicine; it deals with the ethical implications of biological research and applications, especially in medicine. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among biology, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, and philosophy.

While scientific research has produced social benefits, it has also posed some troubling ethical questions. For example, when is it alright to test an experimental cancer drug on people? Developing a new drug takes a long time, maybe as much as 10 years, or more. There are many rules and regulations that drug researchers need to follow while developing drugs to treat specific illnesses.

Generally, drugs cannot be tested on people until researchers have evidence that the drug does what they claim it does, but also that the drug will not make patients more ill or cause death. However, if the drug has tested successfully in earlier experiments, and scientists are quite confident that the drug does what it is intended to do, is it ethical to allow patients with a terminal disease, who have no other treatment options, to try the experimental drug?

With new challenges in public health and health policy arising quickly, and with advances in biotechnology being made, bioethics is a fast-growing academic and professional area of inquiry. Some recent bioethical debates include:

Refusal of medical treatment: the choice of a patient to refuse certain life-saving medical procedures such as a blood transfusion, or refusal by a parent or guardian for medical treatment for the patient.

Euthanasia: the choice by a terminally ill person to have medical assistance in dying.

Stem cell research: research involving stem cells, which can be harvested from human embryos.

Animal cloning: the ability and usefulness of scientists cloning animals for various needs, such as vaccine development, tissues for transplant into humans such as heart valves, and increased food production. Dolly the sheep, probably the most famous animal clone to date, is shown in Figure below .





Figure 2.22

Dolly the sheep is seen here on display in the National museum of Scotland. In 1997, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned, and quickly became world-famous. She was euthanized in 2003 after she developed a common, but serious lung disease. To “grow” her, researchers at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, collected DNA from a mammary cell of another sheep (technically her (older) twin sister), and then injected the DNA into a stem cell which had its own DNA removed. That stem cell then developed into an embryo.



Because research may have a great effect on the well-being of individual people and society in general, scientists are required to behave ethically. Scientists who conduct themselves ethically treat people (called subjects ) who are involved in their research respectfully. Subjects are not allowed to be exploited deliberately, exposed to harm, or forced to do something they do not agree to.

Units of Measurement - Advanced


Identify the units of measurement that scientists use.

List common SI base units.

Name common SI prefixes.





How do you measure something really really small?

If we are talking about a cell, then not with a ruler. Units must exist that can describe sizes many times smaller than the smallest marking on a ruler.





Units of Measurement


The measurements that scientists use are based on the International System of Units (SI), which is a form of the metric system. The term SI is shortened from the French term Le Système international d'unités . It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in science and business. It is useful to scientists because it is based on multiples of 10. The SI was developed in 1960 from an older metric system and is used in almost every country.

The SI is not static, as the technology of measurement progresses, units are created and definitions are changed through international agreement among many nations. The international system of units is made up of a seven base units, shown in the SI Base Units Table below . From these seven base units several other units are derived.

Name Symbol Quantity

meter m length

kilogram kg mass

second s time

ampere A electric current

kelvin K thermal energy (temperature)

mole mol amount of substance

candela cd uminous intensity

A prefix may be added to SI units to make a multiple of the original unit. An SI prefix is a name or symbol that is put before a unit of measure (or its symbol) to form a decimal or a multiple of the unit. For example, kilo - is a multiple of a thousand and milli - is a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimeters in a meter, and one thousand meters in a kilometer . All prefixes are multiples of 10, as you can see from the SI Prefixes Table below . The prefixes are never combined; a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram not a microkilogram .

Name Symbol Factor of 10

tera- T 1,000,000,000,000 (10 12 ) trillion (thousand billion)

giga- G 1,000,000,000 (10 9 ) billion (thousand million)

mega- M 1,000,000 (10 6 ) million

kilo- k 1000 (10 3 ) thousand

hecto- h 100 (10 2 ) hundred

deca- da 10 (10 1 ) ten

deci- d 1 (10 -1 ) tenth

centi- c 0.1 (10 -2 ) hundredth

milli- m 0.01 (10 -3 ) thousandth

micro- µ 0.00001 (10 -6 ) millionth

nano- n 0.00000001 (10 -9 ) billionth

pico- p 0.00000000001 (10 -12 ) trillionth





Vocabulary


International System of Units (SI) : The modern form of the metric system; a system of units of measurement devised around seven base units and the convenience of the number ten.

SI prefixes : A name or symbol that is put before a unit of measure (or its symbol) to form a decimal or a multiple of the unit.





Summary


The measurements that scientists use are based on the International System of Units (SI), which is form of the metric system. Based on multiples of ten, it is the world's most widely used system of units, both in science and business.

Laboratories - Advanced


Identify items that are common to science labs.

Contrast light microscopes and electron microscopes.

Outline what students and researchers can do to stay safe while working in the lab.





What is a laboratory?

When most people think of a scientific laboratory, they picture images similar to those shown here. And it's true that a laboratory must be a controlled environment, but what if certain studies cannot be done in a laboratory setting? How do you observe penguins or elephants in their natural environments? What is the lab then?





The Laboratory


A laboratory is a place that has controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be carried out. Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in industries, in government facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft, such as the one shown in Figure below .



Figure 2.23

Labs are not always Earth-bound, like the biochemistry lab to the left is. This astronaut is working in a lab on the International Space Station (right).



Because of the different areas of science, there are many different types of science labs that each include different scientific equipment. For example, a physics lab might contain a particle accelerator, in which the particles that make up atoms are studied. A chemistry or biology lab most likely contains a fume hood where substances with poisonous fumes can be worked. A particle accelerator and a fume hood are both shown in Figure below . Despite the great differences among labs, some features are common among them.

Most labs have workbenches or counter tops at which the scientist may sit or stand to do work comfortably. This is important because scientists can spend all day working in the lab. A scientist usually records an experiment's progress in a lab notebook, but modern labs almost always contain a computer for data collection and analysis. In many lab's computers are also used for lab simulations (modeling or imitating an experiment or a natural process), and for presenting results in the form of graphs or tables.



Figure 2.24

Different fields of science need different types of equipment, such as the particle accelerator at left, found in a physics lab, and the fume hood, at right, found in chemistry labs, but also sometimes in biology labs.



View http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/aircraft/DC-8/index.html to read about a flying DC-8 laboratory.





Lab Equipment


Lab techniques include the procedures and equipment used in science to carry out an experiment. Lab techniques follow scientific methods; some of them involve the use of simple laboratory equipment such as glassware (shown on the shelves in Figure above ), and some use more complex and expensive equipment such as electrical and computerized machines such as the particle accelerator shown in Figure above .

Equipment commonly found in biology labs includes microscopes, weighing scales or balances, water baths, glassware (such as test tubes, flasks, and beakers), Bunsen burners, pipettes shown in Figure below , chemical reagents, and equipment such as centrifuges and PCR machines.



Figure 2.25

Pipettes are small, but important tools in many biology labs. Micropipettes, such as the ones shown here, are calibrated to measure very small amounts of liquids. For example, 100 microliters (100 µL) is about half the volume of your little finger tip; or even 1 µL, which is much smaller than a drop of water.





Light Microscopes


Microscopes are instruments used to view objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Optical microscopes , such as the one shown in Figure below , use visible light and lenses to magnify objects. They are the simplest and most widely used type of microscopes. Compound microscopes are optical microscopes which have a series of lenses: the ocular lens (in the eyepiece) and the objective lenses (close to the sample). These microscopes have uses in many fields of science-- particularly biology and geology. The scientist in Figure below is looking through a stereo microscope (notice the two lenses). This type of microscope uses the two lenses to produce a three-dimensional visualization of the sample being examined.



Figure 2.26

Compound light microscopes use lenses to focus light. Typical magnification of a light microscope is up to 1500x. The various parts of the microscope are labeled. This specifically is a phase contrast microscope. Phase contrast microscopy is particularly important in biology, as it reveals many cellular structures that are not visible with a simpler bright field microscope.





Figure 2.27

This scientist is using a stereo microscope, which is a light microscope with two ocular lenses.



Resolution is a measure of the clarity of an image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as two separate points. Because light beams have a physical size, which is described in wavelengths, it is difficult to see an object that is about the same size or smaller than the wavelength of light. Objects smaller than about 0.2 micrometers appear fuzzy, and objects below that size cannot be seen.

Magnification involves enlarging the image of an object so that it appears much bigger than its actual size. Magnification also refers to the number of times an object is magnified. For example, a lens that magnifies 100X, magnifies an object 100 times larger than its actual size. Light microscopes have three objective lenses that have different magnifications, as shown in Figure below . The ocular lens has a magnification of 10X, so a 100X objective lens and the ocular lens together will magnify an object by 1000X.



Figure 2.28

Objective lenses of a light microscope.



Visible light has wavelengths of 400 to 700 nanometers, which is larger than many objects of interest such as the insides of cells. Scientists use different types of microscopes in order to get better resolution and magnification of objects that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Objects that are to be viewed under an electron microscope may need to be specially prepared to make them suitable for magnification.





Electron Microscopes


Electron microscopes use electrons instead of photons (light), because electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons and thus allow a researcher to see things at much higher magnification, far higher than an optical microscope can possibly magnify.

There are two general types of electron microscopes: the Transmission Electron Microscope and the Scanning Electron Microscope. The Transmission Electron Microscope shoots electrons through the sample and measures how the electron beam changes because it is scattered in the sample. The Scanning Electron Microscope scans an electron beam over the surface of an object and measures how many electrons are scattered back.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an imaging method in which a beam of electrons is passed through a specimen. An image is formed on photographic film or a fluorescent screen by the electrons that scatter when passing through the object. TEM images show the inside of the object.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope capable of producing high-resolution images of a sample surface. Due to the manner in which the image is created, SEM images have a characteristic three-dimensional appearance and are useful for judging the surface structure of the sample. Sometimes objects need to be specially prepared to make them better suited for imaging under the scanning electron microscope, as shown with the insect in Figure below .

Electron microscopes are usually used in vacuum chambers under low pressures to avoid scattering the electrons in the gas. This makes the microscopes considerably larger and more expensive than optical microscopes. The different types of images from the two electron microscopes are shown in Figure below .

Figure 2.30

SEM and TEM images of the algae Chlamydomonas . The SEM image, shown at the right, is a three-dimensional image of the surface of the organism, whereas the TEM image is a two-dimensional image of the interior of the organism.





Aseptic Technique


In the microbiology lab, aseptic technique refers to the procedures that are carried out under sterile conditions. Scientists who study microbes are called microbiologists. Microbiologists must carry out their lab work using the aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination of themselves, contamination of the environment they are working in, including work surfaces or equipment, and contamination of the sample they are working on. Bacteria live on just about every surface on Earth, so if a scientist wants to grow a particular type of bacterium in the lab, he or she needs to be able to sterilize their equipment to prevent contamination by other bacteria or microorganisms. The aseptic technique is also used in medicine, where it is important to keep the human body free of contamination.

Aseptic technique is used whenever bacteria or other microbes are transferred between nutrient media or in the preparation of the nutrient media. Some equipment that is used in the aseptic technique includes Bunsen burners, autoclaves ( Figure below ), hand and surface sanitizers, neoprene gloves, and fume hoods.

Students of microbiology are taught the principles of aseptic technique by hands-on laboratory practice. Practice is essential in learning how to handle the lab tools without contaminating them.



Figure 2.31

A worktop autoclave. Autoclaves commonly use steam heated to 121°C (250°F), at 103 kPa (15 psi) above atmospheric pressure. Solid surfaces are effectively sterilized when heated to this temperature. Liquids can also be sterilized by this process, though additional time is required to reach sterilizing temperature.





Lab Safety


In some laboratories, conditions are no more dangerous than in any other room. In many labs, though, additional hazards are present. Laboratory hazards are as varied as the subjects of study in laboratories, and might include poisons, infectious agents, flammable, explosive, or radioactive materials, moving machinery, extreme temperatures, or high voltage. The hazard symbols for corrosive, explosive, and flammable substances are shown in Figure below . In laboratories where conditions might be dangerous, safety precautions are important. Lab safety rules minimize a person’s risk of getting hurt, and safety equipment is used to protect the lab user from injury or to help in responding to an emergency.



Figure 2.32

The hazard symbols for corrosive, explosive, and flammable substances.





Figure 2.33

Immediate disposal of used needles, and other sharp equipment into a sharps container is standard procedure.



Some safety equipment that you might find in a biology lab includes:

Sharps Container : A container that is filled with used medical needles and other sharp instruments such as blades, shown in Figure above . Needles or other sharp items that have been used are dropped into the container without touching the outside of the container. Objects should never be pushed or forced into the container, as damage to the container or injuries may result.

Laminar Flow Cabinet : A carefully enclosed bench designed to prevent contamination of biological samples. Air is drawn through a fine filter and blown in a very smooth, laminar (streamlined) flow towards the user. The cabinet is usually made of stainless steel with no gaps or joints where microorganisms might collect.

Gloves : Due to possible allergic reactions to latex, latex gloves are not recommended for lab use. Instead, vinyl or nitrile gloves, shown in Figure below , are often used. Gloves protect the wearers hands and skin from getting contaminated by microorganisms or stained or irritated by chemicals.





Figure 2.34

A nitrile glove. Latex gloves are no longer recommended so vinyl gloves or nitrile gloves, which are usually green or blue in color, are preferred.



Lab Coat : A knee-length overcoat is usually worn while working in the lab. The coat helps to protect the researcher’s clothes from splashes or contamination. The garment is made from white cotton or linen to allow it to be washed at high temperatures and to make it easy to see if it is clean.





Safe Laboratory Practice


Safety precautions are in place to help prevent accidents. Always wear personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves when recommended to do so by your teacher.

Tell your teacher immediately if an accident happens.

The production of aerosols due to poor technique such as squirting the last drop out of pipettes, and the spread of contamination due to spills is completely avoidable and especially important if you are handling infectious material or chemicals.

Wear enclosed toe shoes, instead of sandals or flip flops, or thongs ( Figure below ). Your feet and toes could easily get hurt or broken or if you dropped something.

Do not wear loose, floppy clothes in the lab; they can get caught in or knock over equipment, causing an accident.

If you have long hair, tie it up for the same reasons listed above.

Do not eat or drink in the lab.

Do not use cell phones in the lab, even if you are only sending a text message. You can easily contaminate your phone with whatever you have been working with. Consider where your hands have been, and where your face will be the next time you talk on the phone.

Sweep up broken glass immediately and dispose in a designated area or container, or notify your teacher.

Always listen carefully to your teacher’s instructions.





Figure 2.35

Although they may be comfy and casual, flip-flops and other open-toed shoes are not suitable footwear in the lab.





Accidents


In the case of an accident, it is important to begin by telling your teacher and to know where to find safety equipment.

Some common safety equipment in a school lab:

Fire Extinguishers

Fire Blanket

Eye-Wash Fountain ( Figure below )

First-Aid Kit

Through the first three lessons, we have discussed what science is and how science is done. Now we need to turn our attention to Biology. Biology is the study of life. As the ‘study of life,’ a knowledge of biology is an extremely important aspect of your education. Biology includes the identification and analysis of characteristics common to all living organisms. What is known about biology is discovered or identified through the same processes as all other sciences, including the scientific method and peer review process.

Characteristics of Life - Advanced


Identify the seven characteristics of living things.

Define cell.

Describe an adaptation.

Explain a complex chemistry.

Describe the importance of homeostasis.





What do a bacterium and a whale have in common?

Do they share characteristics with us? All living organisms, from the smallest bacterium to the largest whale, share certain characteristics of life. For example, all living things are made of cells and they must reproduce to make the next generation. Without these characteristics, there is no life .





Characteristics of Life


Biology examines the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things. It classifies and describes organisms, their functions, how species come into existence, and the interactions they have with each other and with the natural environment. Four unifying principles form the foundation of modern biology: cell theory, evolution, genetics and homeostasis.

A powerful introductory video, Characteristics of Life, choreographed to dramatic music, highlighting the wonder of life, and how it is defined can be seen at http://vimeo.com/15407847 (3:40).

Most biological sciences are specialized areas of study. Biology includes biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, physiology, zoology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and botany. Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life. Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms. Immunology is the study of an organism's resistance to disease. Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring. The study of how the human body works is called physiology. Zoology is the study of animals. The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology. Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species change over time. Botany is the study of plants. The four unifying principles are important foundations for each and every field of biology. Applied fields of biology such as medicine and genetic research involve many specialized areas of study.





What is Life?


Not all scientists agree exactly about what makes up life. Many characteristics describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something non-living being classified as living or something living being classified as non-living.

There is not just one distinguishing feature that separates a living thing from a non-living thing. A cat moves but so does a car. A tree grows bigger, but so does a cloud. A cell has structure, but so does a crystal. Biologists define life by listing characteristics that living things share. Something that has all of the characteristics of life is considered to be alive. The duck decoy in Figure below may look like a duck, act like a duck in that it floats about, but it is not alive. The decoy cannot reproduce, respond to its environment, or breathe.



Figure 2.37

Is it a duck? Both of these objects move across the water’s surface. But, how can you tell which one is alive and which is not? You can tell by seeing which of them have all of the characteristics of life.



An individual living creature is called an organism . There are many characteristics that living organisms share. They all:

respond to their environment

grow and change

reproduce and have offspring

have a complex chemistry

maintain homeostasis

are built of structures called cells

pass their traits onto their offspring





Responding to the Environment


All living organisms respond to their environment. If you step on a rock, it will just lie there, but if you step on a turtle, it may move or even snap at you. Living things know what is going on around them, and respond to changes in the environment. An adaptation refers to the process of becoming adjusted to an environment. Adaptations may include structural, physiological, or behavioral traits that improve an organism's likelihood of survival, and thus, reproduction.





Growth and Change


All living organisms have the ability to grow and change. A seed may look like a pebble, but under the right conditions it will sprout and form a seedling that will grow into a larger plant. The pebble of course will not grow. Even the smallest bacteria must grow. This bacteria will reproduce by dividing into two separate bacterium. If the parent bacterium does not grow, then each subsequent generation will just be smaller then the previous generation. Eventually the bacteria will be too small to function properly.



Figure 2.38

Tadpoles, like those shown here, go through many changes to become adult frogs.





Reproduction


All living organisms must have the ability to reproduce. Living things make more organisms like themselves. Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will create more life. If a species cannot create the next generation, the species will go extinct. Reproduction is the process of making the next generation and may be a sexual or an asexual process. Sexual reproduction involves two parents and the fusion of gametes , haploid sex cells from each parent. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically unique and increases genetic variation within a species. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent. It occurs without a fusion of gametes and produces offspring that are all genetically identical to the parent.





Have Complex Chemistry


All living organisms have a complex chemistry. A flower has a complicated and beautiful structure. So does a crystal. But if you look closely at the crystal, you see no change. The flower, on the other hand, is transporting water through its petals, producing pigment molecules, breaking down sugar for energy, and undergoing a large number of other biochemical reactions that are needed for living organisms to stay alive. The sum of all the chemical reactions in a cell is metabolism .





Maintain Homeostasis


A human body has a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, (about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). If you step outside on a cold morning, the temperature might be below freezing. Nevertheless, you do not become an ice cube. You shiver and the movement in your arms and legs allows you to stay warm. Eating food also gives your body the energy it needs to keep warm. Living organisms keep their internal environments within a certain range (they maintain a stable internal condition), despite changes in their external environment. This process is called homeostasis , and is an important characteristic of all living organisms.





Built of Cells


If you look closely at any organism you can see that it is made of structures called cells . Organisms that are very different such as ferns, fish, and elephants all look similar at the cellular level. A cell is the basic unit of structure and function of all living organisms. All living organisms are made of one or more cells: a simple bacterium will consist of just one cell, whereas you are made of trillions of cells.



Figure 2.39

Representations of human cells (left) and onion cells (right). If you looked at human and onion cells under a microscope, this is what you might see.



Organisms are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells. The matter is structured in an ordered way. Atoms are arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules, which make up organelles, which work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire multicellular organisms, as shown in Figure below . Cells together form tissues, which make up organs, which are part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of Earth's ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is Earth.

Unifying Principles of Biology - Advanced


Identify and explain the four unifying principles of modern biology.

Briefly explain the cell theory and the gene theory.

Explain homeostasis.

Define evolution and natural selection.





What is a biological principle?

The word principle can be defined as "a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning." A principle of biology is a fundamental concept that is just as true for a bee or a sunflower as it is for us. All life, including that sunflower and bee, is made of at least one cell. The traits of a particular organism are embedded within its genes, that organism must maintain homeostasis to survive, and that organism has evolved from previously existing species.





Unifying Principles of Biology


There are four unifying principles of biology that are important to all life and form the foundation of modern biology. These are:

the cell theory,

the gene theory,

homeostasis,

evolutionary theory.





The Cell Theory


The cell is the basic unit of structure and function of all organisms. The Cell Theory states that all living things are made of one or more cells, or the secretions of those cells, such as the organisms shown in Figure below . For example, shell and bone are built by cells from substances that they secrete into their surroundings. Cells come from cells that already exist, that is, they do not suddenly appear from nowhere. In organisms that are made of many cells (called multicellular organisms), every cell in the organism's body derives from the single cell that results from a fertilized egg. You will learn more about cells and the Cell Theory in Cells: The Cell Theory (Advanced) concept.



Figure 2.41

Tiny diatoms and whale sharks are all made of cells. Diatoms are about 20 µm in diameter and are made up of one cell, whereas whale sharks can measure up to 12 meters in length, and are made up of billions of cells.





Gene Theory


An organism's traits are encoded in their DNA , the large molecule, or macromolecule, that holds the instructions needed to build cells and organisms. DNA makes up the genes of an organism. Traits are passed on from one generation to the next by way of these genes. Information for how the organism appears and how its cells work come from the organism’s genes. Although the appearance and cell function of the organism may change due to the organism’s environment, the environment does not change its genes. The only way that genes can change in response to a particular environment is through the process of evolution in populations of organisms. You will learn more about DNA and genes in Concept Molecular Biology (Advanced) .





Homeostasis


Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to control its body functions in order to uphold a stable internal environment even when its external environment changes. All living organisms perform homeostasis. For example, cells maintain a stable internal acidity (pH); and warm-blooded animals maintain a constant body temperature. You will learn more about homeostasis in the The Human Body: Homeostasis (Advanced) concept.

Homeostasis is a term that is also used when talking about the environment. For example, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide on Earth has been regulated by the concentration of plant life on Earth, because plants remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the daylight hours than they emit to the atmosphere at night.





Evolution


Evolution by natural selection , is the theory that maintains that a population's inherited traits change over time, and that all known organisms have a common origin. This theory, initially described by Charles Darwin, describes why organisms must adapt to their environments. Evolutionary theory can explain how specialized features, such as the geckos sticky foot pads shown in Figure below , develop in different species. More about evolution is discussed in Concept Evolution (Advanced) .



Figure 2.42

A Tokay Gecko. The pads at the tip of the Tokay gecko's foot are covered in microscopic hairs, each split into hundreds of tips that measure about 200 nanometers in diameter. By using these tiny hairs that can cling to smooth surfaces, the geckos are able to support their entire body weight while climbing walls This is evidence of a product of evolution.





KQED: Bio-Inspiration: Nature as Muse


For hundreds of years, scientists have been using design ideas from structures in nature. Now, biologists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley are working together to design a broad range of new products, such as life-saving milli-robots modeled on the way cockroaches run and adhesives based on the amazing design of a geckos foot. This process starts with making observations of nature, which lead to asking questions and to the additional aspects of the scientific process.

Interdependence - Advanced


Explain the concept of interdependence.

List different types of interactions that organisms can have with each other.

Identify levels of organization within a biological system.

Define biodiversity.





What does it mean to be interdependent ?

Do species live alone, or do many live in communities with other organisms? All species rely on other species in some way in order to survive. They may rely on other species for food, shelter or to help them reproduce. Here the bee is helping the flower spread its pollen. Species are not independent, they are interdependent.





Interdependence of Living Things


Biological interactions are the interactions between different organisms in an environment. In the natural world, no organism is cut off from its surroundings. Organisms are a part of their environment which is rich in living and non-living elements that interact with each other in some way. The interactions of an organism with its environment are vital to its survival, and the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole.

These relationships can be categorized into many different classes. The interactions between two species do not necessarily need to be through direct contact. Due to the connected nature of ecosystems, species may affect each other through such relationships involving shared resources or common enemies.

The term symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means “living together.” Symbiosis can be used to describe various types of close relationships between organisms of different species, such as mutualism and commensalism , which are relationships in which neither organism is harmed. Sometimes the term symbiosis is used only for cases where both organisms benefit, sometimes it is used more generally to describe all kinds of close relationships, even when one organism is killed by another, as shown in Figure below . Symbiosis can also be used to describe relationships where one organism lives on or in another, called parasitism , or when one organism kills and eats another organism, called predation . These relationships will be further described in Concept Ecology (Advanced) .



Figure 2.43

There are many different types of symbiotic interactions between organisms. Clockwise from top left: Escherichia coli bacteria live inside your intestines in a mutualistic relationship: the bacteria produce Vitamin K for you, and they get their food from what you eat. Clownfish that live among the tentacles of sea anemones protect the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators (a special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles). Similar to the E. coli , this bee has a mutualistic relationship with the flower, the bee feeds from the flower, and the flower gets pollinated by the bee. Lions are predators that feed on other organisms such as this Cape buffalo.





Figure 2.44

A flock of starlings looks out, before searching for parasites on a red deer stag.



Competition is as an interaction between organisms or species, for the same resources such as water, food, or hunting grounds in an environment, shown in Figure below . Eventually, the species that is less able to compete for resources will either adapt or die out. According to evolutionary theory, competition for resources plays an important role in natural selection.



Figure 2.45

Competition between organisms and species. These male deer are competing for females during rutting (mating) season. Trees in this forest are in competition for light.



Animals that eat decomposing organic material also have an important interaction with the environment. They help to decompose dead matter and assist with the recycling of nutrients. By burying and eating dung, dung beetles, such as the one shown in Figure below , improve nutrient cycling and soil structure. They make the dead organic matter available to bacteria that break it down even further.



Figure 2.46

Dung beetles have important interactions with the environment, through which many other organisms benefit.



Organisms are not independent, they are interdependent . They cannot live alone; they need other organisms to survive. The same is true for species. All species need other species to survive.





Levels of Organization


In studying how organisms interact with each other, biologists often find it helpful to classify the organisms and interactions into levels of organization. Similar to the way an organism itself has different levels of organization, the ways in which organisms interact with their environment and each other can also be divided into levels of organization. For example:

The biosphere includes all living things within all of their environments. It includes every part of the environment where life exists, from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to the bottoms of the oceans. An ecosystem is made up of the relationships among smaller groups of organisms with each other, and with their environment. Scientists often speak of the interrelatedness of living things, because, according to evolutionary theory, organisms adapt to their environment, and they must also adapt to other organisms in that environment.

A community is made up of the relationships between groups of different species. For example, the desert communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds, mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus, ocotillo, and creosote bush. Community structure can be disturbed by such dynamics as fire, human activity, and over-population.

A population is a group of individuals of a single species that mate and interact with one another in a limited geographic area. For example, a field of flowers which is separated from another field by a hill or other area where none of these flowers occur.

It is thus possible to study biology at many levels, from collections of organisms or communities, to the inner workings of a cell (organelle). More about the interactions of organisms will be discussed in Concept Ecology (Advanced) .



Figure 2.47

This picture shows the levels of organization in nature, from the individual organism to the biosphere.





The Diversity of Life


Evolutionary theory and the cell theory give us the basis for how and why organisms relate to each other. The diversity of life found on Earth today is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. Some of this diversity is shown in Figure below . The origin of life is not completely understood by science, though limited evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established a few 100 million years after Earth formed. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life was made up of single-celled organisms.

The level of biodiversity found in the fossil record suggests that the last few million years include the period of greatest biodiversity in the Earth's history. However, not all scientists support this view, since there is a lot of uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of more recent fossil-containing rock layers. Some researchers argue that modern biodiversity is not much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago. Estimates of the present global species diversity vary from 5 million to 30 million species, with a best estimate of somewhere near 10 million species. All living organisms are classified into one of the six kingdoms: Archaebacteria (Archaea), Eubacteria (Bacteria), Protista (Protists), Fungi, Plantae (Plants), and Animalia (Animals).

New species are regularly discovered and many, though already discovered, are not yet classified. The animal kingdom comprises just a tiny portion of classified organisms. Every year, scientists discover the existence of many hundreds more archaea and bacteria than were previously known. More about the diversity of living creatures will be discussed throughout numerous concepts.



Figure 2.48

Animal diversity. This figure shows just a fraction of the diversity of life. The diversity of organisms found in the five kingdoms of life, dwarf the number of organisms found in the animal kingdom. The other kingdoms of life are Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, and Plantae.

What is a dinosaur?

A dinosaur is from a class of reptiles. They are diverse reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic period, approximately 230 million years ago, and were the dominant land vertebrates for 135 million years, from the beginning of the Jurassic period (about 200 million years ago) until they went extinct, at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65.5 million years ago. They are very strong evidence of evolution, the change in species over time. Dinosaurs went extinct because they could not adapt to a catastrophic environmental change. The ability to adapt to a changing environment is a key feature of natural selection, the process of evolution.





Evolution of Life


Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over time. It is a process that began on this planet well over 3.5 billion years ago and continues to this day, as populations of organisms continue to change.

Evolution occurs as organisms acquire and pass on new traits from one generation to the next generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and the great diversity of the biological world. Extant species are related to each other through common descent, and products of evolution over billions of years. Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicates there is a similarity among very different organisms in the genetic code that help make proteins and other molecules. This genetic code is used by all known forms of life on Earth. The theory of evolution suggests that the genetic code was established very early in the history of life, and some studies suggest it was established soon after the formation of Earth. The timeline of the evolution of life, shown in Figure below , outlines the major events in the development of life.



Figure 2.49

According to recent estimates, the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in the rocks that form the Earth's crust. The rock layers themselves, like pages in thick history book, record the surface shaping events of the past. Buried within them are traces of life, including the plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that existed perhaps as many as 3 to 3.5 billion years ago.



How do scientists know Earth is so old? The answer is in the rocks. Contained in rocks that were once molten, shown in Figure below , are chemical elements that act like an atomic clock. The atoms of different forms of elements (called isotopes ) break down at different rates over time. Parent isotopes within these rocks decay at a predictable rate to form daughter isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated—forming the so-called atomic clock.

Thus, the results of studies of rock layers ( stratigraphy ), and of fossils ( paleontology ), along with the ages of certain rocks as measured by atomic clocks ( geochronology ), indicate that the Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, with the oldest known rocks being 3.96 billion years old. More about the history of life on Earth will be discussed in History of Life: Introduction (Advanced) concept.



Figure 2.50

Molten rock, called lava , is expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The lava will eventually cool to become solid rock. When first expelled from a volcanic vent, it is a liquid at temperatures from 700 °C to 1,200 °C (1,300 °F to 2,200 °F). Not all types of rocks come from cooled lava, but many do.



Additional images/videos of volcanic eruptions can be seen at Hawaii Volcanic Eruption with Lightning and USGS Kilauea Volcano: http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/gallery/kilauea/volcanomovies/ .



Figure 2.51

This timeline shows the history of life on Earth. In the entire span of the time, humans are a relatively new addition.





History of Evolutionary Thought


The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more "fit" to survive in a particular environment and have "adapted" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.



Figure 2.52

Charles Darwin, left (1809-1882), and Alfred Russel Wallace, right (1823-1913). Both scientists proposed a process of evolution by natural selection at about the same time. However, Darwin is primarily associated with the theory of evolution by natural selection due to his abundance of data.



The theory of evolution encountered initial resistance from religious authorities who believed humans were divinely set apart from the animal kingdom. There was considerable concern about Darwin’s proposal of an entirely scientific explanation for the origin of humans. Many people found such an explanation to be in direct conflict with their religious beliefs. A caricature of Darwin as a monkey, shown in Figure below , reflects the controversy that arose over evolutionary theory. In the 1930s, Darwinian natural selection was combined with Mendelian inheritance to form the basis of modern evolutionary theory.



Figure 2.53

An 1871 caricature portraying Darwin with an ape body and the bushy beard he grew in 1866. Such satire reflected the cultural backlash against evolution.



The identification of DNA as the genetic material by Oswald Avery and colleagues in the 1940s, as well as the publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, demonstrated the physical basis for inheritance. Since then, genetics and molecular biology have become core aspects of evolutionary biology.

Currently the study of evolutionary biology involves scientists from fields as diverse as biochemistry, ecology, genetics and physiology, and evolutionary concepts are used in even more distant disciplines such as psychology, medicine, philosophy and computer science.





Misconceptions About Evolution


The following list includes some common misconceptions about evolution.

The term evolution describes the changes that occur in populations of living organisms over time. Describing these changes does not address the origin of life. The two are commonly and mistakenly confused. Biological evolution likewise says nothing about cosmology, the Big Bang, or where the universe, galaxy, solar system, or Earth came from.

Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees or any other modern ape; instead they share a common ancestor that existed around 7 million years ago.

The process of evolution is not necessarily slow. Millions of years are not required to see evolution in action. Indeed, it has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.

Evolution is not a progression from "lower" to "higher" forms of life, and it does not increase in complexity. For example, bacteria have simpler structures and a smaller amount of genetic material than humans do. This does not mean however, that bacteria are “less evolved” than humans are. Bacteria have evolved over many millions of years and are well adapted to their own environments.





After Darwin


Since Darwin's time, scientists have gathered a more complete fossil record, including microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added more information to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, which were areas unknown to Darwin. Another growing subject is the study of comparative anatomy, which looks at how different organisms have similar body structures. Molecular biology studies of slowly changing genes reveal an evolutionary history that is consistent with fossil and anatomical records.





Vocabulary


evolution : The change in the characteristics of living organisms over time; the change in species over time.

geochronology : The study of the age of rocks.

isotope : An atom of a different form of the same element.

natural selection : Evolutionary process by which certain beneficial traits becomes more common within a population, changing the characteristics (traits) of a species over time.

paleontology : The study of fossils.

stratigraphy : The study of rock layers.





Summary


Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicate that there is a similarity in the genetic codes that help make proteins and other molecules in very different organisms.

The theory of evolution by natural selection is based on the concept of the survival of the fittest, where individuals with beneficial traits are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment in which they live.

Nobel Prizes


Explain what the Nobel Prize is.





What is the highest honor a scientist can be awarded?

The Nobel Prize, awarded each October in six categories, including physiology or medicine and chemistry.





The Nobel Prize


The Nobel Prize is an international award given each year to honor outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and for work in peace. The award is maintained by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, named after Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), a scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, author and pacifist. At the age of 17, Alfred Nobel spoke five languages fluently. He went on to become an inventor and businessman, and at the time of his death, he had 355 patents worldwide, one which was the patent for dynamite. More importantly, he had started 87 companies world-wide. He had an unprecedented idea for his wealth. See http://www.nobelprize.org for additional information.

In his last will, dated November 27, 1895, Nobel left instructions for the prize. After leaving sums of monies to various friends and relatives, Nobel stated in his will, "The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not."

The first five Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. In 1969, another prize was added: "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel."

Many of the contributions of Nobel laureates are discussed throughout these concepts. The contributions from the physiology or medicine are directly related to the life sciences, as are selected contributions from the chemistry prize.

Summary


How are the life sciences studied? The scientific method is the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identified. This method has produced scientific theories and laws, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution. All life, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, and all other prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants and animals in between, have characteristics of life in common. All life responds to their environment, grows and changes, reproduces and has offspring, has a complex chemistry, maintains homeostasis, is built of structures called cells and passes their traits onto their offspring.

Chemistry of Life - Advanced


Introduction




What do you see when you look at this picture? Is it just a mass of tangled ribbons? Look closely. It’s actually a complex pattern of three-dimensional shapes. It represents the structure of a common chemical found inside living cells. The chemical is a protein called hemoglobin. It is the protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen around the body.

What are proteins? What other chemicals are found in living things? You will learn the answers to these questions as you read about the chemistry of life.





Chemical Substances - Advanced


Distinguish between atoms, elements, and ions.

Compare ionic bonds to covalent bonds.

Define organic compound.

Describe elements and compounds, and explain how mixtures differ from compounds.





Take some Cs, Hs, Ns, Os, Ps and Ss, combine them in many different combinations, and what do you get?

In just the right combinations, you get life. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. Some of the most basic of elements, but some of the most important. Together they can form countless combinations of organic compounds. And in just the right combinations, anything can happen.





Chemical Substances


Living things are made of matter. In fact, matter is the “stuff” of which all things are made. Anything that occupies space and has mass is known as matter. Matter, in turn, consists of chemical substances. A chemical substance is a material that has a definite chemical composition. It is also homogeneous, so the same chemical composition is found uniformly throughout the substance. A chemical substance may be an element or a chemical compound.





Elements


An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into different types of substances. There are almost 120 known elements ( Figure below ), each with its own personality. The chemical and physical properties of one element differ from any other. Elements are arranged according to their properties in the Periodic Table .



Figure 3.1

The Periodic Table.



Examples of elements include carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, gold, silver and iron. Each element is made up of just one type of atom. An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still characterizes the element. As shown in Figure below , at the center of an atom is a nucleus. The nucleus contains positively charged particles called protons and electrically neutral particles called neutrons. Surrounding the nucleus is a much larger electron cloud consisting of negatively charged electrons. Electrons are arranged into distinct energy levels, at various distances from the nucleus. An atom is electrically neutral if it has the same number of protons as electrons. Each element has atoms with a characteristic number of protons, which defines the atomic number of the element. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, and all oxygen atoms have eight protons. A combination of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus gives the approximate atomic mass of the atom, measured in an amu, or atomic mass unit. For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and an atomic mass of 1.00794 amu; carbon has an atomic number of 6 and an atomic mass of 12.0107 amu; oxygen has an atomic number of 8 and an atomic mass of 15.9994 amu. See the Dynamic Periodic Table at http://www.ptable.com for additional information.

Over 100 elements can be seen in this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFsdbLFHgY8 (10:00).

Figure 3.2

Model of an Atom. The protons and neutrons of this atom make up its nucleus. Electrons surround the nucleus.



The majority of known elements are classified as metals. Metals are elements that are lustrous, or shiny. They are also good conductors of electricity and heat. Examples of metals include iron, gold, and copper. Fewer than 20 elements are classified as nonmetals. Nonmetals lack the properties of metals. Examples of nonmetals include oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur. Certain other elements have properties of both metals and nonmetals. They are known as metalloids. Examples of metalloids include silicon and boron.

Chemical Compounds


A chemical compound is a new substance that forms when atoms of two or more elements react with one another. A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances. A compound that results from a chemical reaction always has a unique and fixed chemical composition. The substances in the compound can be separated from one another only by another chemical reaction. This is covered further in Concept Biochemistry (Advanced) . Atoms bond with each other through the interactions of their electrons, specifically their outermost or valence electrons.

The atoms of a compound are held together by chemical bonds. Chemical bonds form when atoms share electrons. There are different types of chemical bonds, and they vary in how strongly they hold together the atoms of a compound. Two of the strongest types of bonds are covalent and ionic bonds. Covalent bonds form between atoms that have little if any difference in electronegativity, and result when atoms share electrons. Electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract electrons toward itself. Ionic bonds , in contrast, form between atoms that are significantly different in electronegativity. An ion is an atom that has gained or lost at least one electron. Ionic bonds form between ions of opposite charges.

An example of a chemical compound is water. A water molecule forms when oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms react and are held together by covalent bonds. Like other compounds, water always has the same chemical composition: a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms. This is expressed in the chemical formula H 2 O. A model of a water molecule is shown in Figure below .



Figure 3.3

Model of a water molecule, showing the arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The protons (8 in oxygen, 1 in hydrogen) and neutrons (8 in oxygen) are depicted in the nucleus.



Compounds that contain mainly the elements carbon and hydrogen are called organic compounds . This is because they are found mainly in living organisms. Most organic compounds are held together by covalent bonds. An example of an organic compound is glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ), which is shown in Figure below . Glucose is a simple sugar that living cells use for energy. All other compounds are called inorganic compounds. Water is an example of an inorganic compound.

A short animation describing chemical compounds can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HjMoTthEZ0 (3:53).

Figure 3.4

Glucose Molecule. This model represents a molecule of glucose, an organic compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The chemical formula for glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 . This means that each molecule of glucose contains six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms. NOTE: Each unlabeled point where lines intersect represents another carbon atom. Some of these carbons and the oxygen atom are bonded to another hydrogen atom, not shown here.





Mixtures vs. Compounds


Like a chemical compound, a mixture consists of more than one chemical substance. Unlike a compound, a mixture does not have a fixed chemical composition. The substances in a mixture can be combined in any proportions. A mixture also does not involve a chemical reaction. Therefore, the substances in a mixture are not changed into unique new substances, and they can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction.

The following examples illustrate these differences between mixtures and compounds. Both examples involve the same two elements: the metal iron (Fe) and the nonmetal sulfur (S).

When iron filings and sulfur powder are mixed together in any ratio, they form a mixture. No chemical reaction occurs, and both elements retain their individual properties. A magnet can be used to mechanically separate the two elements by attracting the iron filings out of the mixture and leaving the sulfur behind.

When iron and sulfur are mixed together in a certain ratio and heated, a chemical reaction occurs. This results in the formation of a unique new compound, called iron sulfide (FeS). A magnet cannot be used to mechanically separate the iron from the iron sulfide because metallic iron does not exist in the compound. Instead, another chemical reaction is required to separate the iron and sulfur.

Carbon. Element number six. Right in the middle of the first row of the Periodic Table. So what?

Carbon is the most important element to life. Without this element, life as we know it would not exist. As you will see, carbon is the central element in compounds necessary for life-organic compounds. These compounds include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids.





The Significance of Carbon


Why is carbon so important to organisms? The answer lies with carbon’s unique properties. Carbon has an exceptional ability to bind with a wide variety of other elements. Carbon makes four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds, allowing carbon atoms to form multiple stable bonds with other small atoms, including hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Carbon atoms can also form stable bonds with other carbon atoms. In fact, a carbon atom may form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon atoms. This allows carbon atoms to form a tremendous variety of very large and complex molecules.





Organic Compounds


Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds. This property allows carbon to form the backbone of organic compounds , carbon-containing compounds, which are the basis of all known organic life. Nearly 10 million carbon-containing organic compounds are known. Types of carbon compounds in organisms include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The elements found in each type are listed in the table below. Elements other than carbon and hydrogen usually occur within organic compounds in smaller groups of elements called functional groups . When organic compounds react with other compounds, generally just the functional groups are involved. Therefore, functional groups generally determine the nature and functions of organic compounds.

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including carbohydrates (sugars), lignans (important in plants), chitins (the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods), alcohols, lipids and fats (triglycerides), and carotenoids (plant pigment). With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur in addition to the nitrogen, it forms amino acids which bind together to form proteins , antibiotics, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, carbon forms nucleotides which bond into nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , which is known as the energy currency of the cell. The properties of all these organic molecules is related to the composition of the elements that compose the molecule. Certain carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids are known as macromolecules, as they are very large polymers made of individual monomers.

During condensation reactions, water is produced from the two molecules being bonded together; an H from one monomer is joined to an -OH from another molecule, producing H 2 O.

Carbohydrates - Advanced


Describe the structure and function of carbohydrates.

State the formula of glucose.

Distinguish between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.

Describe the structure and function of complex carbohydrates.





Sugar. Does this look like biological energy?

As a child, you may have been told that sugar is bad for you. Well, that's not exactly true. Essentially, carbohydrates are made of sugar, from a single sugar molecule to thousands of sugar molecules all attached together. Why? One reason is to store energy. But that does not mean you should eat it by the spoonful.





Carbohydrates


Carbohydrates are organic compounds that contain only carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). They are the most common of the four major types of organic compounds. There are thousands of different carbohydrates, but they all consist of one or more smaller units called monosaccharides.





Monosaccharides and Disaccharides


The general formula for a monosaccharide is (CH 2 O) n , where n can be any number greater than two. For example, if n is 6, then the formula can be written C 6 H 12 O 6 . This is the formula for the monosaccharide glucose. Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently. Molecules with the same chemical formula but with atoms in a different arrangement are called isomers . Compare the glucose and fructose molecules in Figure below . Can you identify their differences? The only differences are the positions of some of the atoms. These differences affect the properties of the two monosaccharides.

Monosaccharides can be classified by the number of carbon atoms they contain: diose (2), triose (3), tetrose (4), pentose (5), hexose (6), heptose (7), and so on.

In addition to glucose, other common monosaccharides include fructose ("fruit sugar"), galactose, xylose ("wood sugar") and ribose (in RNA) and deoxyribose (in DNA).

If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a disaccharide . Two monosaccharides will bond together through a dehydration reaction, in which a water molecule is lost. A dehydration reaction is a condensation reaction , a chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, losing a small molecule in the process. In the dehydration reaction, this small molecule is water. The bond between two monosaccharides is known as a glycosidic bond .

An example of a disaccharide is sucrose (table sugar), which consists of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose ( Figure below ). Other common disaccharides include lactose ("milk sugar") and maltose. Monosaccharides and disaccharides are also called simple sugars . They provide the major source of energy to living cells.



Figure 3.5

Sucrose Molecule. This sucrose molecule is a disaccharide. It is made up of two monosaccharides: glucose on the left and fructose on the right. Sucrose forms through a condensation reaction: glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) + fructose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) sucrose (C 12 H 22 O 11 ).





Oligosaccharides


An oligosaccharide is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides can have many functions; for example, they are commonly found on the plasma membrane of animal cells where they can play a role in cell–cell recognition. In general, they are found attached to compatible amino acid side-chains in proteins or to lipids.

Oligosaccharides are often found as a component of glycoproteins or glycolipids. They are often used as chemical markers on the outside of cells, often for cell recognition. An example is ABO blood type specificity. A and B blood types have two different oligosaccharide glycolipids embedded in the cell membranes of the red blood cells, AB-type blood has both, while O blood type has neither.





Polysaccharides


Polysaccharides are long carbohydrate molecules of repeated monomer units joined together by glycosidic bonds. A polysaccharide may contain anywhere from a few monosaccharides to several thousand monosaccharides. Polysaccharides are also called complex carbohydrates . Polysaccharides have a general formula of C x (H2O) y , where x is usually a large number between 200 and 2500. Considering that the repeating units in the polymer backbone are often six-carbon monosaccharides, the general formula can also be represented as (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n , where 40≤n≤3000.

Starches are one of the more common polysaccharides. Starch is made up of a mixture of amylose (15–20%) and amylopectin (80–85%). Amylose consists of a linear chain of several hundred glucose molecules and amylopectin is a branched molecule made of several thousand glucose units. Starches can be digested by hydrolysis reactions , catalyzed by enzymes called amylases , which can break the glycosidic bonds. Humans and other animals have amylases, so they can digest starches. Potato, rice, wheat, and maize are major sources of starch in the human diet. The formations of starches are the ways that plants store glucose. Glycogen is sometimes referred to as animal starch. Glycogen is used for long-term energy storage in animal cells. Glycogen is made primarily by the liver and the muscles.

The main functions of polysaccharides are to store energy and form structural tissues. Examples of several other polysaccharides and their roles are listed in the Table below . These complex carbohydrates play important roles in living organisms.

Lipids - Advanced


Describe the structure and function of lipids.

Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.

Name and describe various types of lipids.





Oil. Does it mix with water? No. Biologically, why is this important?

Oil is a lipid. The property of chemically not being able to mix with water gives lipids some very important biological functions. A particular type of lipid - the phospholipid - is the main component of the outer membrane of all cells. Why?





Lipids


Lipids are organic compounds that contain mainly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They include substances such as fats and oils, as well as waxes, sterols, some vitamins (A, D, E and K) and phospholipids. Lipid molecules consist of fatty acids, with or without additional molecules. Fatty acids are organic compounds that have the general formula CH 3 (CH 2 ) n COOH, where n usually ranges from 2 to 28 and is always an even number.

A distinguishing feature of lipids is that they are insoluble in water. The main biological functions of lipids include energy storage, as the major structural component of cell membranes, and as important signaling molecules.





Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids


Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated. The term saturated refers to the placement of hydrogen atoms around the carbon atoms. In a saturated fatty acid , all the carbon atoms (other than the carbon in the -COOH group) are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible (usually two hydrogens). Saturated fatty acids do not contain any other groups except the -COOH. This is why they form straight chains, as shown in Figure below . Because of this structure, saturated fatty acids can be packed together very tightly. This allows organisms to store chemical energy very densely. The fatty tissues of animals contain mainly saturated fatty acids.



Figure 3.6

Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids. Saturated fatty acids include arachidic, stearic, and palmitic fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids include all the other fatty acids in the figure. Notice how all the unsaturated fatty acids have bent chains, whereas the saturated fatty acids have straight chains.



In an unsaturated fatty acid , some carbon atoms are not bonded to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms. This is because they are bonded to one or more additional groups, including double and triple bonds between carbons. Wherever these other groups bind with carbon, they cause the chain to bend - they do not form straight chains ( Figure above ). This gives unsaturated fatty acids different properties than saturated fatty acids. For example, unsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature whereas saturated fatty acids are solids. Unsaturated fatty acids are found mainly in plants, especially in fatty tissues such as nuts and seeds.

Unsaturated fatty acids occur naturally in the bent shapes shown in Figure above . However, unsaturated fatty acids can be artificially manufactured to have straight chains like saturated fatty acids. Called trans fatty acids , these synthetic lipids were commonly added to foods until it was found that they increased the risk for certain health problems. Many food manufacturers no longer use trans fatty acids for this reason.



Figure 3.7

These plant products all contain unsaturated fatty acids.





Types of Lipids


Lipids may consist of fatty acids alone or in combination with other compounds. Several types of lipids consist of fatty acids combined with a molecule of alcohol:

Triglycerides are the main form of stored energy in animals. This type of lipid is commonly called fat. Triglycerides are composed of a glycerol and three fatty acid chains. An example is shown in Figure below . In humans, triglycerides are a mechanism for storing unused calories, and their high concentration in blood correlates with the consumption of excess starches and other carbohydrate-rich foods.

Phospholipids are a major component of the membranes surrounding the cells of all organisms, as they have the ability to form bilayers. The structure of the phospholipid molecule consists of two hydrophobic tails (a diglyceride made of two fatty acid chains) and a hydrophilic head (a phosphate group, PO 4 3- ).

Steroids (or sterols) have several functions. Sterols are a subgroup of steroids. The sterol cholesterol is an important part of cell membranes and plays other vital roles in the body. Cholesterol is a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones. Steroid hormones include the male and female sex hormones. Sterols also have roles as second messengers in signalling pathways.





Figure 3.8

Triglyceride Molecule. The left part of this triglyceride molecule represents glycerol. Each of the three long chains on the right represents a different fatty acid. From top to bottom, the fatty acids are palmitic acid, oleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid. The chemical formula for this triglyceride is C 55 H 98 O 6 . KEY: H=hydrogen, C=carbon, O=oxygen





Lipids and Diet


Humans need lipids for many vital functions such as storing energy and forming cell membranes. Lipids can also supply cells with energy. In fact, a gram of lipids supplies more than twice as much energy as a gram of carbohydrates or proteins. Lipids are necessary in the diet for most of these functions. Although the human body can manufacture most of the lipids it needs, there are others, called essential fatty acids , that must be consumed in food. Essential fatty acids include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Both of these fatty acids are needed for important biological processes, not just for energy.

Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

Proteins - Advanced


Give examples of protein functions.

Identify the general structure of an amino acid.

Describe the four levels of protein structure.





You may have been told proteins are good for you. Do these look good to you?

Proteins as food? To you, these may not look appetizing (or they might), but they do provide a nice supply of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Proteins have many important roles, from transporting, signaling, receiving, and catalyzing to storing, defending, and allowing for movement. Where do you get the amino acids needed so your cells can make their own proteins? If you cannot make the amino acids yourself - and some of them you cannot make - then you must eat them.





Proteins


Proteins are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, in some cases, sulfur. These compounds may many essential functions within the cell (see below). Proteins are made of smaller units called amino acids . There are 20 different common amino acids needed to make proteins. All amino acids have the same basic structure, which is shown in Figure below . Only the side chain (labeled R in the figure) differs from one amino acid to another. These side chains can vary in size from just one hydrogen atom in glycine to a large heterocyclic group in tryptophan. The variable side chain gives each amino acid unique properties. The side chains can also characterize the amino acid as (1) nonpolar or hydrophobic, (2) neutral (uncharged) but polar, (3) acidic, with a net negative charge, and (4) basic, with a net positive charge at neutral pH.

Proteins can differ from one another in the number and sequence (order) of amino acids. It is because of the side chains of the amino acids that proteins with different amino acid sequences have different shapes and different chemical properties. Small proteins can contain just a few hundred amino acids. Yeast proteins average 466 amino acids. The largest known proteins are the titins, found in muscle, which are composed from over 27,000 amino acids.



Figure 3.9

General Structure of Amino Acids. This model shows the general structure of all amino acids. Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another. For example, in the amino acid glycine, the side chain is simply hydrogen (H). In glutamic acid, in contrast, the side chain is CH 2 CH 2 COOH. Variable side chains give amino acids acids different chemical properties. The order of amino acids, together with the properties of the amino acids, determines the shape of the protein, and the shape of the protein determines the function of the protein. KEY: H = hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain





Protein Structure


Amino acids can bond together through peptide bonds to form short chains called peptides or longer chains called polypeptides ( Figure below ). A peptide bond is a covalent bond formed from a condensation reaction between two molecules, causing the release of a molecule of water. This bond usually forms between two amino acids, hence forming a peptide or polypeptide. Peptide bonds between amino acids are formed during the process of translation.

Polypeptides may have as few as 40 amino acids or as many as several thousand. A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains. The sequence of amino acids in a protein’s polypeptide chain(s) determines the overall structure and chemical properties of the protein.



Figure 3.10

Polypeptide. This polypeptide is a chain made up of many linked amino acids.



The amino acid sequence is the primary structure of a protein. As explained in Figure below , a protein may have up to four levels of structure, from primary to quaternary. The complex structure of a protein allows it to carry out its biological functions.

Secondary structure refers to local sub-structures generated from the primary structure, usually involving alpha helix and beta pleated sheet structures. These secondary structures form through hydrogen bonding between amino acids.

Tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional structure of a single polypeptide. The alpha-helices and beta-sheets are folded into a compact globule structure. Stability is maintained through hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and other interactions.

Quaternary structure is a larger assembly of several polypeptide chains, now referred to as subunits of the protein. The quaternary structure is stabilized by the same interactions as the tertiary structure. Complexes of two or more polypeptides are called multimers. Specifically, a dimer contains two subunits, a trimer contains three subunits, and a tetramer contains four subunits.



Figure 3.11

Protein Structure. Primary protein structure is the sequence of amino acids in a single polypeptide. Secondary protein structure refers to internal shapes, such as alpha helices and beta pleated sheets, that a single polypeptide takes on due to bonds between atoms in different parts of the polypeptide. Tertiary protein structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of a protein consisting of one polypeptide. Quaternary protein structure is the shape of a protein consisting of two or more polypeptides. For a brief animation of protein structure, see www.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/proteins/protein%20structure.swf .



The atomic mass of proteins is measured in kilodaltons (kDa). One dalton (Da) is approximately equal to the mass of one proton or one neutron, so a carbon atom has a mass of approximately 12 Da. The molecular weights of amino acids range from 75 Da for glycine to 204 for tryptophan. Human proteins may have molecular weights ranging from a low of about 3.7 kDA to titian, the largest known human protein with 34,350 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 3,816.2 kDa.





Functions of Proteins


Proteins are an essential part of all organisms. They play many roles in living things. Certain proteins provide a scaffolding that maintains the shape of cells (structural proteins). Proteins also make up the majority of muscle tissues. Many proteins are enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in cells. Enzymes interact with the substrates (reactants) of a biochemical reaction, helping the reaction proceed at a much faster rate. Other proteins are antibodies that protect you from pathogens. Antibodies bond to foreign substances in the body and target them for destruction. Still other proteins help carry messages or materials in and out of cells (transport proteins) or around the body. For example, the blood protein hemoglobin (see Figure below ) bonds with oxygen and carries it from the lungs to cells throughout the body.



Figure 3.12

Hemoglobin Molecule. This model represents the protein hemoglobin. The red parts of the molecule contain iron. The iron binds with oxygen molecules.

One of the most important traits of proteins, allowing them to carry out these functions, is their ability to bond with other molecules. They can bond with other molecules very specifically and tightly. This ability, in turn, is due to the complex and highly specific structure of protein molecules. The structure-function relationship of proteins is an important principle of biology. A slight difference in the structure of a protein can lead to a difference in the function of that protein, and this can have devastating effects on the cell or organism.





Proteins and Diet


Proteins in the diet are necessary for life. Dietary proteins are broken down into their component amino acids when food is digested. Cells can then use the components to build new proteins. Humans are able to synthesize all but nine of the twenty common amino acids. These nine amino acids, called essential amino acids , must be consumed in foods. Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also be broken down to provide cells with energy. The amino acids regarded as essential for humans are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, methionine, leucine, lysine, and histidine. Additionally, cysteine, tyrosine and arginine are required by infants and growing children.

In addition, certain amino acids (arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, histidine, proline, serine and tyrosine) are considered conditionally essential, meaning they are not normally required in the diet, but must be supplied to specific populations that do not synthesize them in adequate amounts. An example would be with the disease phenylketonuria (PKU) . Individuals with PKU must keep their intake of phenylalanine extremely low to prevent mental retardation and other metabolic complications. However, they cannot synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, so tyrosine becomes essential in the diet of PKU patients. PKU can be easily detected with a simple blood test. All states in the US require a PKU screening test for all newborns as part of the newborn screening panel. These individuals are placed on a special diet as soon as the disease is detected, a diet that is extremely low in phenylalanine, particularly when the child is growing. The diet must be strictly followed. Those who continue the diet into adulthood have better physical and mental health. Maintaining the diet for life has become the standard recommended by most experts.

Describe the structure and function of ATP.





You may have heard that "it's in your DNA." What does that mean?

Nucleic acids. Essentially the "instructions" or "blueprints" of life. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the unique blueprints to make the proteins that give you your traits. Half of these blueprints come from your mother, and half from your father. And they come in different combinations every time. In fact, every couple - every man and woman that has every lived - together has over 64,000,000,000,000 combinations of their chromosomes, which is where the DNA is found. Therefore, every person that has ever lived - except for identical twins - has his or her own unique set of blueprints - or instructions - or DNA.





Nucleic Acids


Nucleic acids are organic compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They are made of smaller units called nucleotides . Nucleic acids are named for the nucleus of the cell, where some of them are found. Nucleic acids are found not only in all living cells but also in viruses. Types of nucleic acids include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) .





Structure of Nucleic Acids


A nucleic acid consists of one chain (in RNA) or two chains (in DNA) of nucleotides held together by chemical bonds. Each individual nucleotide unit consists of three parts:

a base (containing nitrogen)

a sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA)

a phosphate group (containing phosphorus)



The sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide. Alternating sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of a nucleotide chain, as shown in Figure below . The bases, which are bound to the sugars, protrude from the backbone of the chain. In DNA, pairs of bases-one from each of two nucleotides-form the middle section of the molecule.



Figure 3.13

Part of a Nucleic Acid (DNA). This small section of a nucleic acid shows how phosphate groups and sugars alternate to form the backbone of a nucleotide chain. The bases that jut out to the side from the backbone are adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, such as between adenine and thymine, hold the two chains of nucleotides together.

An overview of DNA can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-vZ_g7K6P0 (28:05).



Click on the image above for more content

RNA consists of a single chain of nucleotides, and DNA consists of two chains of nucleotides. Bonds form between the bases on the two chains of DNA and hold the chains together ( Figure above ). There are four different types of bases in a nucleic acid molecule: cytosine (C), adenine (A), guanine (G), and either thymine (T) (in DNA) or uracil (U) (in RNA). Each type of base bonds with just one other type of base. Cytosine and guanine always bond together, and adenine and thymine (or uracil) always bond with one another. The pairs of bases that bond together are called complementary bases .

The binding of complementary bases allows DNA molecules to take their well-known shape, called a double helix . Figure below shows how two chains of nucleotides form a DNA double helix. A simplified double helix is illustrated in Figure below . It shows more clearly how the two chains are intertwined. The double helix shape forms naturally and is very strong. Being intertwined, the two chains are difficult to break apart. This is important given the fundamental role of DNA in all living organisms.



Figure 3.14

DNA Molecule. Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases help form the double helix of a DNA molecule. The letters A, T, G, and C stand for the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The sequence of these four bases in DNA is a code that carries instructions for making proteins. Shown is a representation of how the double helix folds into a chromosome. In this double-stranded nucleic acid, complementary bases (A and T, C and G) form hydrogen bonds that hold the two nucleotide chains together in the shape of a double helix. Notice that A always bonds with T and C always bonds with G. The hydrogen bonds help maintain the double helix shape of the molecule.





Figure 3.15

Simple Model of DNA. In this simple model of DNA, each line represents a nucleotide chain. The double helix shape forms when the two chains wrap around the same axis.



A brief overview of DNA, stressing the base-pairing rules, can be seen in the following animation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwfO6SzGaEg (1:28).

Role of Nucleic Acids


The order of bases in nucleic acids is highly significant. The bases are like the letters of a four-letter alphabet. These "letters" can be combined to form "words." Groups of three bases form words of the genetic code . Each code word, called a codon, stands for a different amino acid. A series of many codons spells out the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide or protein ( Figure below ). In short, nucleic acids contain the information needed for cells to make proteins. This information is passed from a body cell to its daughter cells when the cell divides. It is also passed from parents to their offspring when organisms reproduce.





How RNA codes for Proteins




Figure 3.16

The letters G, U, C, and A stand for the bases in RNA, specifically mRNA or messenger RNA. Each group of three bases makes up a codon, and each codon represents one amino acid (represented here by a single letter, such as V (valine), H (histidine), or L (leucine)). A string of codons specifies the sequence of amino acids in a protein.



DNA and RNA have different functions relating to the genetic code and proteins. Like a set of blueprints, DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in proteins. RNA uses the information in DNA to assemble the amino acids and make the proteins. More about the genetic code and the role of nucleic acids will be discussed in Concept Molecular Biology (Advanced) .





Adenosine Triphosphate


Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) , or Adenosine-5'-triphosphate, is another important nucleic acid. ATP is described as the "energy currency" of the cell or the "molecular unit of currency." One molecule of ATP contains three phosphate groups, and it is produced by ATP synthase from inorganic phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The structure of ATP consists of the purine base adenine, attached to the 1' carbon atom of the pentose sugar ribose. Three phosphate groups are attached at the 5' carbon atom of the pentose sugar. It is the removal of these phosphate groups that convert ATP to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and to AMP (adenosine monophosphate). ATP is produced during cellular respiration, and will be further discussed in the Cellular Respiration (Advanced) concepts.

ATP is used as a substrate in signal transduction pathways by kinases that phosphorylate proteins and lipids, as well as by adenylate cyclase, which uses ATP to produce the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP). The ratio between ATP and AMP determines the amount of available energy. This regulates the metabolic pathways that produce and consume ATP. Apart from its roles in energy metabolism and signaling, ATP is also incorporated into DNA and RNA by polymerases during both DNA replication and transcription. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase.



Figure 3.17

ATP. The ATP molecule clearly shows the three phosphate groups.

Water, Water Everywhere


"Water is the driving force of all nature," Leonardo da Vinci.



Water is a common chemical substance on Earth. The term water generally refers to its liquid state. Water is a liquid over a wide range of standard temperatures and pressures. However, water can also occur as a solid (ice) or gas (water vapor).





Where Is All the Water?


Of all the water on Earth, about two percent is stored underground in spaces between rocks. A fraction of a percent exists in the air as water vapor, clouds, or precipitation. Another fraction of a percent occurs in the bodies of plants and animals. So where is most of Earth’s water? It’s on the surface of the planet. In fact, water covers about 70 percent of Earth’s surface. Of water on Earth’s surface, 97 percent is salt water, mainly in the ocean. Only 3 percent is fresh water . Most of the fresh water is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining fresh water occurs in rivers, lakes, and other fresh water features.



Figure 3.18

Most of the water on Earth consists of saltwater in the oceans. What percent of Earth’s water is fresh water? Where is most of the fresh water found?



Although clean fresh water is essential to human life, in many parts of the world it is in short supply. The amount of fresh water is not the issue. There is plenty of fresh water to go around, because water constantly recycles on Earth. However, fresh water is not necessarily located where it is needed, and clean fresh water is not always available.





How Water Recycles


Like other matter on Earth, water is continuously recycled. Individual water molecules are always going through the water cycle , in which molecules of water cycle through both the living and non-living parts of the biosphere (discussed in the Recycling Matter: The Water Cycle (Advanced) concept). In fact, water molecules on Earth have been moving through the water cycle for billions of years. In this cycle, water evaporates from Earth’s surface (or escapes from the surface in other ways), forms clouds, and falls back to the surface as precipitation. This cycle keeps repeating. Several processes change water from one state to another during the water cycle. They include:

Evaporation —Liquid water on Earth’s surface changes into water vapor in the atmosphere.

Sublimation —Snow or ice on Earth’s surface changes directly into water vapor in the atmosphere.

Transpiration —Plants give off liquid water, most of which evaporates into the atmosphere.

Condensation —Water vapor in the atmosphere changes to liquid water droplets, forming clouds or fog.

Precipitation —Water droplets in clouds are pulled to Earth’s surface by gravity, forming rain, snow, or other type of falling moisture.





Figure 3.19

Like other biogeochemical cycles, there is no beginning or end to the water cycle. It just keeps repeating.





Vocabulary


condensation : The process by which water vapor in the atmosphere changes to liquid water droplets, forming clouds or fog.

evaporation : Liquid water on Earth’s surface changes into water vapor in the atmosphere.

fresh water : Naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams; characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids.

precipitation : Forms when water droplets in clouds become large enough to fall, forming rain, snow, or other type of falling moisture.

sublimation : The transformation of snow and ice directly into water vapor; occurs as the snow and ice are heated by the sun.

transpiration : A process by which plants lose water; occurs when stomata in leaves open to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and lose water to the atmosphere in the process.

water cycle : The continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth; also called the hydrologic cycle.





Summary


Most of Earth’s water is salt water located on the planet’s surface.

Water is constantly recycled through the water cycle, cycling through both the living and non-living parts of the biosphere.

Explain how water’s structure related to its unique properties.





What may be the most important molecule for life?

Some may argue DNA. Some may argue certain proteins. But many would argue water. And what makes water so important? Its properties. The nature of the three atoms and how they interact with each other. This allows water to be a polar molecule, which allows it to interact with many other molecules necessary for life. Most of the substances in a cell are floating around in a water-based cytoplasmic environment.





Chemical Structure and Properties of Water


You are probably already familiar with many of water’s properties. For example, you no doubt know that water is tasteless, odorless, and transparent. In small quantities, it is also colorless. However, when a large amount of water is observed, as in a lake or the ocean, it is actually light blue in color. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light. These and other properties of water depend on its chemical structure.

The transparency of water is important for organisms that live in water. Because water is transparent, sunlight can pass through it. Sunlight is needed by water plants and other water organisms for photosynthesis.





Chemical Structure of Water


Each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen, so it has the chemical formula H 2 O. The arrangement of atoms in a water molecule, shown in Figure below , explains many of water’s chemical properties. In each water molecule, the nucleus of the oxygen atom (with 8 positively charged protons) attracts electrons much more strongly than do the hydrogen nuclei (with only one positively charged proton). This results in a negative electrical charge near the oxygen atom (due to the "pull" of the negatively charged electrons toward the oxygen nucleus) and a positive electrical charge near the hydrogen atoms. A difference in electrical charge between different parts of a molecule is called polarity . A polar molecule is a molecule in which part of the molecule is positively charged and part of the molecule is negatively charged.



Figure 3.20

This model shows the arrangement of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule. A water molecule has a bent or angular (non-linear) shape, with an angle of about 105°. The nucleus of the oxygen atom attracts electrons more strongly than do the hydrogen nuclei. As a result, the middle part of the molecule near oxygen has a negative charge, and the other parts of the molecule have a positive charge. In essence, the electrons are "pulled" toward the nucleus of the oxygen atom and away from the hydrogen atom nuclei. Water is a polar molecule, with an unequal distribution of charge throughout the molecule.





Figure 3.21

This model is an atomic diagram of water, showing the two hydrogen atoms and oxygen atom in the center. The protons (red) are in the center (nucleus) of each atom, and the electrons (light blue) circle each nucleus.





Figure 3.22

This diagram shows the positive and negative parts of a water molecule. It also depicts how a charge, such as on an ion (Na or Cl, for example) can interact with a water molecule.





Hydrogen Bonding


Opposite electrical charges attract one another. Therefore, the positive part of one water molecule is attracted to the negative parts of other water molecules. Because of this attraction, bonds form between hydrogen and oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules, as demonstrated in Figure below . This type of bond always involves a hydrogen atom, so it is called a hydrogen bond . Hydrogen bonds are bonds between molecules, and they are not as strong as bonds within molecules. Nonetheless, they help hold water molecules together.



Figure 3.23

Hydrogen bonds form between positively and negatively charged parts of water molecules. The bonds hold the water molecules together. How do you think this might affect water’s properties?



Hydrogen bonds can also form within a single large organic molecule. For example, hydrogen bonds that form between different parts of a protein molecule bend the molecule into a distinctive shape, which is important for the protein’s functions. Hydrogen bonds also hold together the two nucleotide chains of a DNA molecule.





Sticky, Wet Water


Water has some unusual properties due to its hydrogen bonds. One property is cohesion , the tendency for water molecules to stick together. The cohesive forces between water molecules are responsible for the phenomenon known as surface tension . The molecules at the surface do not have other like molecules on all sides of them and consequently they cohere more strongly to those directly associated with them on the surface. For example, if you drop a tiny amount of water onto a very smooth surface, the water molecules will stick together and form a droplet, rather than spread out over the surface. The same thing happens when water slowly drips from a leaky faucet. The water doesn't fall from the faucet as individual water molecules but as droplets of water. The tendency of water to stick together in droplets is also illustrated by the dew drops in Figure below .



Figure 3.24

Droplets of dew cling to a spider web, demonstrating cohesion, the tendency of water molecules to stick together because of hydrogen bonds.



Another important physical property of water, is adhesion . In terms of water, adhesion is the bonding of a water molecule to another substance, such as the sides of a leaf's veins. This process happens because hydrogen bonds are special in that they break and reform with great frequency. This constant rearranging of hydrogen bonds allows a percentage of all the molecules in a given sample to bond to another substance. This grip-like characteristic that water molecules form causes capillary action , the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space. An example of capillary action is when you place a straw into a glass of water. The water seems to climb up the straw before you even place your mouth on the straw. The water has created hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, causing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw. As the hydrogen bonds keep interchanging with the straw's surface, the water molecules interchange positions and some begin to ascend the straw.

Adhesion and capillary action are necessary to the survival of most organisms. It is the mechanism that is responsible for water transport in plants through roots and stems, and in animals through small blood vessels.

Hydrogen bonds also explain why water’s boiling point (100°C) is higher than the boiling points of similar substances without hydrogen bonds. Because of water’s relatively high boiling point, most water exists in a liquid state on Earth. Liquid water is needed by all living organisms. Therefore, the availability of liquid water enables life to survive over much of the planet.

Furthermore, water has a high specific heat because it takes a lot of energy to raise or lower the temperature of water. As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation. Since cells are made up of water, this property helps to maintain homeostasis .





Density of Ice and Water


The melting point of water is 0°C. Below this temperature, water is a solid (ice). Unlike most chemical substances, water in a solid state has a lower density than water in a liquid state. This is because water expands when it freezes. Again, hydrogen bonding is the reason. Hydrogen bonds cause water molecules to line up less efficiently in ice than in liquid water. As a result, water molecules are spaced farther apart in ice, giving ice a lower density than liquid water. A substance with lower density floats on a substance with higher density. This explains why ice floats on liquid water, whereas many other solids sink to the bottom of liquid water.

In a large body of water, such as a lake or the ocean, the water with the greatest density always sinks to the bottom. Water is most dense at about 4°C. As a result, the water at the bottom of a lake or the ocean usually has temperature of about 4°C. In climates with cold winters, this layer of 4°C water insulates the bottom of a lake from freezing temperatures. Lake organisms such as fish can survive the winter by staying in this cold, but unfrozen, water at the bottom of the lake.

Describe a neutralization reaction.

Give examples of acids and bases in organisms.





Acids and bases. Why are these important in biology?

It comes back to a number of biological and biochemical processes. For example, some enzymes work best at specific pH levels of acids. Other biochemical reactions need a relatively neutral environment to function properly. Take your stomach, a very acidic environment. The enzyme pepsin that works best in that acidic environment could not work in your mouth. What would your food taste like if your mouth was also a very acidic environment? Other biochemical reactions need a relatively neutral environment to function properly.





Solutions


Water is one of the most common ingredients in solutions. A solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. In a solution, one substance is dissolved in another substance, forming a mixture that has the same proportion of substances throughout. The dissolved substance in a solution is called the solute . The substance in which it is dissolved is called the solvent . An example of a solution in which water is the solvent is salt water. In this solution, a solid—sodium chloride—is the solute. In addition to a solid dissolved in a liquid, solutions can also form with solutes and solvents in other states of matter. Examples are given in the Table below .

Solutions and Three States of Matter Gas Liquid Solid

Gas Oxygen and other gases in nitrogen (air)

Liquid Carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water) Ethanol (an alcohol) in water Sodium chloride in water (salt water)

Solid Hydrogen gas in metals Mercury in silver and other metals (dental fillings) Iron in carbon (steel)

The ability of a solute to dissolve in a particular solvent is called solubility . Many chemical substances are soluble in water. In fact, so many substances are soluble in water that water is called the universal solvent. Water is a strongly polar solvent, and polar solvents are better at dissolving polar solutes. Many organic compounds and other important biochemicals are polar, so they dissolve well in water. On the other hand, strongly polar solvents like water cannot dissolve strongly nonpolar solutes like oil. Did you ever try to mix oil and water? Even after being well shaken, the two substances quickly separate into distinct layers.





Acids and Bases


Water is the solvent in solutions called acids and bases. To understand acids and bases, it is important to know more about pure water, in which nothing is dissolved. In pure water (such as distilled water), a tiny fraction of water molecules naturally breaks down, or dissociates, to form ions. An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule. The dissociation of pure water into ions is represented by the chemical equation:

2 H 2 O → H 3 O + + OH - .

The products of this reaction are a hydronium ion (H 3 O + ) and a hydroxide ion (OH - ). The hydroxide ion is negatively charged. It forms when a water molecule donates, or gives up, a positively charged hydrogen ion. The hydronium ion, modeled in Figure below , is positively charged. It forms when a water molecule accepts a positively charged hydrogen ion (H + ).



Figure 3.25

A hydronium ion has the chemical formula H 3 O + . The plus sign ( + ) indicates that the ion is positively charged. How does this molecule differ from a water molecule?

Acidity and pH


Acidity refers to the hydronium ion concentration of a solution. It is measured by pH . In pure water, the hydronium ion concentration is very low. Only about one in ten million water molecules naturally dissociates to form a hydronium ion in pure water. This gives water a pH of 7. The hydronium ions in pure water are also balanced by hydroxide ions, so pure water is neutral (neither an acid nor a base).

Because pure water is neutral, any other solution with the same hydronium ion concentration and pH is also considered to be neutral. If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions and lower pH than pure water, it is called an acid . If a solution has a lower concentration of hydronium ions and higher pH than pure water, it is called a base . Several acids and bases and their pH values are identified on the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, in Figure below .



Figure 3.26

Acidity and the pH Scale. Water has a pH of 7, so this is the point of neutrality on the pH scale. Acids have a pH less than 7, and bases have a pH greater than 7. Approximate pHs of examples are depicted.



The pH scale is a negative logarithmic scale. Because the scale is negative, as the ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. In other words, the more acidic the solution, the lower the pH value. Because the scale is logarithmic, each one-point change in pH reflects a ten-fold change in the hydronium ion concentration and acidity. For example, a solution with a pH of 6 is ten times as acidic as pure water with a pH of 7.





Acids


An acid can be defined as a hydrogen ion donor. The hydrogen ions bond with water molecules, leading to a higher concentration of hydronium ions than in pure water. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolves in pure water, it donates hydrogen ions (H + ) to water molecules, forming hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) and chloride ions (Cl - ). This is represented by the chemical equation:

HCl + H 2 O → Cl - + H 3 O + .

Strong acids can be harmful to organisms and damaging to materials. Acids have a sour taste and may sting or burn the skin. Testing solutions with litmus paper is an easy way to identify acids. Acids turn blue litmus paper red.





Bases


A base can be defined as a hydrogen ion acceptor. It accepts hydrogen ions from hydronium ions, leading to a lower concentration of hydronium ions than in pure water. For example, when the base ammonia (NH 3 ) dissolves in pure water, it accepts hydrogen ions (H + ) from hydronium ions (H 3 O + ) to form ammonium ions (NH 4 + ) and hydroxide ions (OH - ). This is represented by the chemical equation:

NH 3 + H 2 O → NH 4 + + OH - .

Like strong acids, strong bases can be harmful to organisms and damaging to materials. Bases have a bitter taste and feel slimy to the touch. They can also burn the skin. Bases, like acids, can be identified with litmus paper. Bases turn red litmus paper blue.





Neutralization


What do you think would happen if you mixed an acid and a base? If you think the acid and base would “cancel each other out,” you are right. When an acid and base react, they form a neutral solution of water and a salt (a molecule composed of a positive and negative ion). This type of reaction is called a neutralization reaction . For example, when the base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react, they form a neutral solution of water and the salt sodium chloride (NaCl). This reaction is represented by the chemical equation:

NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H 2 O.

In this reaction, hydroxide ions (OH - ) from the base combine with hydrogen ions (H + ) from the acid to form water. The other ions in the solution (Na + ) and (Cl - ) combine to form sodium chloride.





Acids and Bases in Organisms


Enzymes are needed to speed up biochemical reactions. Most enzymes require a specific range of pH in order to do their job. For example, the enzyme pepsin , which helps break down proteins in the human stomach, requires a very acidic environment in order to function. Strong acid is secreted into the stomach, allowing pepsin to work. Once the contents of the stomach enter the small intestine, where most digestion occurs, the acid must be neutralized. This is because enzymes that work in the small intestine need a basic environment. An organ near the small intestine, called the pancreas, secretes bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 - ) into the small intestine to neutralize the stomach acid.

Bicarbonate ions play an important role in neutralizing acids throughout the body. Bicarbonate ions are especially important for protecting tissues of the central nervous system from changes in pH. The central nervous system includes the brain, which is the body’s control center. If pH deviates too far from normal, the central nervous system cannot function properly. This can have a drastic effect on the rest of the body.

Water and Life - Advanced


Explain why water is essential for life processes.

Describe various biochemical reactions involving water.





Condensation. Just in clouds?

Condensation occurs in your cells constantly. It occurs in the form of a chemical reaction. These condensation reactions involve the formation of a water molecule from two other molecules. Water forms when two molecules, such as amino acids or monosaccharides, are joined together. The amino acids join together to form peptides (or polypeptides or proteins) and the monosaccharides join together to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.





Water and Life


Humans are composed of about 60-70 percent water (not counting water in body fat). This water is crucial for normal functioning of the body. Water’s ability to dissolve most biologically significant compounds—from inorganic salts to large organic molecules—makes it a vital solvent inside organisms and cells.

Water is an essential part of most metabolic processes within organisms. Metabolism is the sum total of all body reactions, including those that build up molecules ( anabolic reactions ) and those that break down molecules ( catabolic reactions ). In anabolic reactions, water is generally removed from small molecules in order to make larger molecules. In catabolic reactions, water is used to break bonds in larger molecules in order to make smaller molecules.

Water is central to two related, fundamental metabolic reactions in organisms: photosynthesis and cellular respiration . All organisms depend directly or indirectly on these two reactions. In photosynthesis, cells use the energy in sunlight to change water and carbon dioxide into glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ). This is an anabolic reaction, represented by the chemical equation:

6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O + energy → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 .

In cellular respiration, cells break down glucose in the presence of oxygen and release energy, water, and carbon dioxide. This is a catabolic reaction, represented by the chemical equation:

C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 → 6 CO 2 + 6 H 2 O + energy

Two other types of reactions that occur in organisms and involve water are dehydration and hydration reactions. A dehydration reaction occurs when molecules combine to form a single, larger molecule and also a molecule of water. (If some other small molecule is formed instead of water, the reaction is called by the more general term, condensation reaction .) It is a type of anabolic reaction. An example of a dehydration reaction is the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids in a polypeptide chain. When two amino acids bond together, a molecule of water is lost. This is shown in Figure below .



Figure 3.27

In this dehydration reaction, two amino acids form a peptide bond. A water molecule also forms.



A hydration reaction is the opposite of a dehydration reaction. A hydration reaction adds water to an organic molecule and breaks the large molecule into smaller molecules. Hydration reactions occur in an acidic water solution. An example of hydration reaction is the breaking of peptide bonds in polypeptides. A hydroxide ion (OH - ) and a hydrogen ion (H + ) (both from a water molecule) bond to the carbon atoms that formed the peptide bond. This breaks the peptide bond and results in two amino acids.

Water is essential for all of these important chemical reactions in organisms. As a result, virtually all life processes depend on water. Clearly, without water, life as we know it could not exist.





Vocabulary


anabolic reaction : Endothermic reaction that occurs in organisms; chemical reaction that builds new molecules and/or stores energy.

catabolic reaction : Chemical reaction that breaks down more complex organic molecules into simpler substances; usually releases energy.

cellular respiration : Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).

condensation reaction : A chemical reaction in which two molecules combine to form one single molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule, often water.

dehydration reaction : A condensation reaction that involves the loss of water from the reacting molecule (product).

hydration reaction : A chemical reaction in which a water molecule is added to a molecule, breaking the reactant into two separate products.

metabolism : The sum of all the chemical reactions in a cell and/or organism.

photosynthesis : The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.

Water is essential for most life processes, including photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and other important chemical reactions that occur in organisms.

Summary


The cell is the basic unit of life. A cell is made of molecules, which are made of elements. All life-which means all bacteria and archaea, all protists, fungi, plants and animals-is built around the element carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. These molecules come together to form a cell, which is the basis of life. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life. One other molecule, water, is also essential to life, though water is not an organic compound.

Introduction




What is a cell?

It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life. This concept will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell and cell communication.





Cells - Advanced


Describe the importance of cells to biology.





Why is a cell so complex?

Cells have lots of things to do. Some cells make the whole organism, so that one cell must do everything that organism needs to do to live. Other cells perform specific functions, so they must be designed to do that specific activity.





Introduction to Cells


The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. A cell is also the smallest unit of life, with single-celled organisms present on this planet for over 3.5 billion years. Single-celled ( unicellular ) organisms like bacteria are obviously composed of just one cell, whereas multicellular organisms can be composed of trillions of cells. Multicellular organisms include protists (though single-celled protists also exist), fungi, plants and animals. Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100 µm and therefore can only be observed under the microscope.

The one cell of a unicellular organism must be able to perform all the functions necessary for life. These functions include metabolism, homeostasis and reproduction. Specifically, these single cells must transport materials, obtain and use energy, dispose of wastes, and continuously respond to their environment. The cells of a multicellular organism also perform these functions, but they may do so in collaboration with other cells.

Cells are essentially carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids in a water-based environment. It is the lipid (phospholipid) membrane that keeps the water-based environment in the cell separate from the water-based environment outside the cell. But a cell, even the single cell of a unicellular organism, must be able to interact with its external environment. The cell must be able to bring molecules in from the outside, and expel unwanted waste products. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is necessary to all of the biological sciences.

Learning about the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell biology and molecular biology. Cell biology is the field of biology that studies cells. In particular, cell biologists study a cell's physiological properties, structure, organelles , interactions with the extracellular environment, life cycle, division and death. Molecular biology concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the relationships between DNA, RNA and proteins.

Research in cell biology is closely linked to molecular biology, as well as genetics, biochemistry and developmental biology. The importance of the similarities and differences between cell types is a unifying theme in biology. They allow the principles learned from studying one cell type to be applied when learning about other cell types. For example, learning about how single-celled bacteria function can help us understand more about how human cells function. Understanding basic cellular processes, such as cell division or metabolism in bacteria, gives information about similar processes in our cells.

The microscope of course. Objects that were too small to be seen with the human eye were unknown until the microscope was developed. Once this instrument was developed, a whole new field of science was initiated.





Discovery of Cells


If you look at living organisms under a microscope you will see they are made up of cells. The word cell , derived from the Latin word cellula meaning small compartment, was first used by Robert Hooke, a British biologist and early microscopist . Hooke looked at thin slices of cork under a microscope. The structure he saw looked like a honeycomb as it was made up of many tiny units. Hooke’s drawing is shown in Figure below . In 1665 Hooke published his book Micrographia, in which he wrote:

... I could exceedingly plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular.... these pores, or cells, ... were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this...

This figure is a drawing of the structure of cork from Micrographia as it appeared under the microscope to Robert Hooke.



During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.

Fortunately, Leeuwenhoek took great care in writing detailed reports of what he saw under his microscope. He was the first person to report observations of many microscopic organisms. Some of his discoveries included tiny animals such as ciliates, foraminifera, roundworms, and rotifers, shown in Figure below . He discovered blood cells and was the first person to see living sperm cells. In 1683, Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society of London about his observations on the plaque between his own teeth, "a little white matter, which is as thick as if 'twere batter." He called the creatures he saw in the plaque animacules, or tiny animals. This report was among the first observations on living bacteria ever recorded.

Microscopes in Biology - Advanced


Outline the importance of microscopes in the discovery of cells.

Describe contemporary microscopes that are used for biological research.





How do you see something that is too small to be seen by a light microscope?

Use an electron microscope. This instrument has a resolution many times greater than a light microscope, and can be used to see the details on the outside of a cell. Some electron microscopes can also be used to see the details inside a cell.





Microscopes


Hooke’s and Leeuwenhoek’s studies and observations filled people with wonder because their studies were of life forms that were everywhere, but too small to see with the naked eye. Just think how amazed you would be if you were to read about the first accounts of a newly discovered microorganism from the moon or Mars. Your first thought might be "Things can live there?!" which was probably the first thought of the people who read Hooke’s and Leeuwenhoek’s accounts. The microscope literally opened up an amazing new dimension in the natural sciences, and became a critical tool in the progress of biology.

Magnifying glasses had been in use since the 1300s, but the use of lenses to see very tiny objects was a slowly-developing technology. The magnification power of early microscopes was very limited by the glass quality used in the lenses and the amount of light reflected off the object. These early light microscopes had poor resolution and a magnification power of about 10 times. Compare this to the over 200 times magnification that Leeuwenhoek was able to achieve by carefully grinding his own lenses. However, in time the quality of microscopes was much improved with better lighting and resolution. It was through the use of light microscopes that the first discoveries about the cell and the cell theory (1839) were developed. The Figure below is an example of an early light microscope used by Robert Hooke (1665), the microscopist who was the first to discover cells.

However, by the end of the 19 th century, light microscopes had begun to hit resolution limits, and microscopy became a significant tool in the biological sciences. Resolution is a measure of the clarity of an image; it is the minimum distance that two points can be separated by and still be distinguished as two separate points. Because light beams have a physical size, it is difficult to see an object that is about the same size as the wavelength of light. Objects smaller than about 0.2 micrometers appear fuzzy, and objects below that size just cannot be seen. Light microscopes were still useful, but most organelles and tiny cell structures were invisible to the light microscope.



Figure 4.4

Electron Microscopes


In the 1930s, a new system was developed that could use a beam of electrons to resolve very tiny dimensions at the molecular level. Electron microscopes , one of which is shown in Figure above , have been used to produce images of molecules and atoms. They have been used to visualize the tiny sub-cellular structures that were invisible to light microscopes. Many of the discoveries made about the cell since the 1950s have been made with electron microscopes. The first electron microscope was the transmission electron microscope (TEM) . The TEM works on the same principle as an optical microscope , but uses electrons instead of light and electromagnets in the place of glass lenses. Electrons have a much lower wavelength, which makes it possible to get a resolution a thousand times better than with a light microscope. The TEM allows scientists to study the topographical, morphological, compositional and crystalline details in the cell or different materials near the atomic levels, as seen in the Figure below .

Development of the TEM was quickly followed in 1935 by the development of the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM forms an image of a sample by scanning it with a beam of electrons. The electrons interact with the atoms that make up the sample producing signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography, morphology and composition. Although it is not as powerful as its TEM counterpart, the interactions that take place on the surface of the specimen provide a greater depth of view, higher resolution and more detailed surface picture.



Figure 4.5

Electron Microscope Image of Organelles. An electron microscope produced this image of a cell.



The 1980s saw the development of the first scanning probe microscopes. The first was the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981. Scanning Probe Microscopy forms images of surfaces using a physical probe that scans the specimen. The most recent developments in light microscope largely center on the rise of fluorescence microscopy. A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence instead of (or sometimes, in addition to) reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic samples.

KQED: Confocal Microscopy


Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by using point illumination and a spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane. These important features also allow confocal microscopes to collect double and triple labels(most commonly used for detecting fluorescent labels), since precise colocalizations can be performed. Examples of specific uses of the confocal microscope are:

to resolve the structure of various complex three-dimensional objects, such as networks of cytoskeletal fibers in the cytoplasm of cells

the arrangements of chromosomes and genes in a cell's nucleus during different points in the cell division cycle

observing pollen grains whose complex cell wall can only be seen clearly using confocal microscopy



Cutting-edge confocal microscopes, at the University of California, San Francisco are helping scientists create three-dimensional images of cells, and may help lead to new medical breakthroughs, including a treatment for Type 1 diabetes.

The Cell Theory - Advanced


Summarize the principle points of the Cell Theory.





Where do cells come from?

All cells come from other cells. It was the advent of the microscope that allowed this discovery to be made. And it is one of the three basic points of the Cell Theory. This picture represents cell division, the process of one cell dividing into two cells.





The Cell Theory


Over the next two centuries after the discoveries of Hooke and Leeuwenhoek, biologists found cells everywhere. Biologists in the early part of the 19 th century suggested that all living things were made of cells , but the role of cells as the primary building block of life was not discovered until 1839 when two German scientists, Theodor Schwann, a zoologist , and Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a botanist , suggested that cells were the basic unit of structure and function of all living things. Later, in 1858, the German doctor Rudolf Virchow observed that cells divide to produce more cells. He proposed that all cells arise only from other cells. The collective observations of all three scientists form the Cell Theory , which states that:

all organisms are made up of one or more cells,

all the life functions of an organism occur within cells,

all cells come from preexisting cells.



Though no one point of the Cell Theory is more important than another, the theory clearly states that the functions necessary for life occur in the cell. Findings since the time of the original Cell Theory have enabled scientists to "modernize" the theory, including points related to biochemistry and molecular biology . The modern version of the Cell Theory includes:

all known living things are made up of one or more cells,

all living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division,

the cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms,

the activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells,

energy flow ( metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells,

cells contain hereditary information ( DNA ) which is passed from cell to cell during cell division ,

all cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.



The Cell Theory is one of the main principles of biology. The points of the theory have been found to be true for all life. As with any scientific theory, the Cell Theory is based on observations that over many years upheld the basic conclusions of Schwann’s 1839 paper. However, one of Schwann’s original conclusions stated that cells formed in a similar way to crystals. This observation, which refers to spontaneous generation of life, was discounted when Virchow proposed that all cells arise only from other cells. The Cell Theory has withstood intense examination of cells by modern powerful microscopes and other instruments. Scientists continue to use new techniques and equipment to look into cells to discover additional explanations for how they work.





Vocabulary

botanist : A person engaged in botany, the science of plant life.



cell : The basic unit of structure and function of all living organisms.



cell division : The process of cell formation from the division of older cells.



cell theory : One of the foundations of biology; refers to the idea that cells are the basic unit of structure and function of all life.



deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) : Double-stranded nucleic acid that composes genes and chromosomes; the hereditary material.



metabolism : The sum of all the chemical reactions in a cell and/or organism.



molecular biology : The field of biology that deals with the molecular basis of biological activity; the study of molecules that make up living organisms.



spontaneous generation : An obsolete principle regarding the origin of life from inanimate matter.



zoologist : A person engaged in zoology, the branch of biology that focuses on the animal kingdom; studies the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct.





Summary


The Cell Theory states that all living things are made of one or more cells, that cells are the basic unit of life, and that cells come only from other cells.

The Cell Theory has been updated to include findings based on more recent findings.

Cell Size and Shape - Advanced


Identify the limitations on cell size. Describe the relationship between volume and surface area.

Discuss cell shape and its relationship to cell function.





What determines a cell's function?

The cell's structure has a lot to do with it. Notice in the representation of skin that there are different layers. These layers have different functions. Also notice the difference in cell shape within the different layers. The structure-function relationship is a central theme running throughout biology.





Diversity of Cells


Different cells within a single organism can come in a variety of sizes and shapes. They may not be very big, but their shapes can be very different from each other. However, these cells all have common abilities, such as obtaining and using food energy, responding to the external environment, and reproducing. In part, a cell’s shape determines its function.





Cell Size


If cells are the main structural and functional unit of an organism, why are they so small? And why are there no organisms with huge cells? The answers to these questions lie in a cell’s need for fast, easy food. The need to be able to pass nutrients and gases into and out of the cell sets a limit on how big cells can be. The larger a cell gets, the more difficult it is for nutrients and gases to move in and out of the cell.

As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .





Scale of Measurements


1 centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm) = 10 -2 meters (m)

1 mm = 1000 micrometers (µm) = 10 -3 m

1 µm = 1000 nanometers (nm) = 10 -6 m

1 nm = 10 -3 µm





Figure 4.6

A small cell (left), has a larger surface-area to volume ratio than a bigger cell (center). The greater the surface-area to volume ratio of a cell, the easier it is for the cell to get rid of wastes and take in essential materials such as oxygen and nutrients. In this example, the large cell has the same area as 27 small cells, but much less surface area.



Imagine cells as little cube blocks. If a small cube cell like the one in the Figure above is one unit (u) in length, then the total surface area of this cell is calculated by the equation:

height × width × number of sides × number of boxes

1u × 1u × 6 × 1 = 6u 2



The volume of the cell is calculated by the equation:

height × width × length × number of boxes

1u × 1u × 1u × 1 = 1u 3



The surface-area to volume ratio is calculated by the equation:

area ÷ volume

6 ÷ 1 = 6



A larger cell that is 3 units in length would have a total surface area of

3u × 3u × 6 × 1 = 54u 2



and a volume of:

3u × 3u × 3u × 1 = 27u 3



The surface-area to volume ratio of the large cell is:

54 ÷ 27 = 2



Now, replace the three unit cell with enough one unit cells to equal the volume of the single three unit cell. This can be done with 27 one unit cells. Find the total surface area of the 27 cells:

1u × 1u × 6 × 27 = 162u 2



The total volume of the block of 27 cells is:

1 × 1 × 1 × 27 = 27u 3



The surface-area to volume ratio of the 27 cells is:

162 ÷ 27 = 6



An increased surface area to volume ratio means increased exposure to the environment. This means that nutrients and gases can move in and out of a small cell more easily than in and out of a larger cell.



Figure 4.7

Ostrich eggs (A) can weigh as much as 1.5 kg and be 13 cm in diameter, whereas each of the mouse cells (B) shown at right are each about 10 µm in diameter, much smaller than the period at the end of this sentence.



The cells you have learned about so far are much smaller than the period at the end of this sentence, so they are normally measured on a very small scale. The smallest prokaryotic cell currently known has a diameter of only 400 nm. Eukaryotic cells normally range between 1– 100µm in diameter. The mouse cells in Figure above are about 10 µm in diameter. One exception, however, is eggs . Eggs contain the largest known single cell, and the ostrich egg is the largest of them all. The ostrich egg in Figure above is over 10,000 times larger than the mouse cell.





Cell Shape


The variety of cell shapes seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects the functions that each cell has, confirming the structure-function relationship seen throughout biology. Each cell type has evolved a shape that is best related to its function. For example, the neuron in Figure below has long, thin extensions ( axons and dendritres ) that reach out to other nerve cells. The extensions help the neuron pass chemical and electrical messages quickly through the body. The shape of the red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) enable these cells to easily move through capillaries . The spikes on the pollen grain help it stick to a pollinating insect or animal so that it can be transferred to and pollinate another flower. The long whip-like flagella (tails) of the algae Chlamydomonas help it swim in water.



Figure 4.8

Cells come in very different shapes. Left to right, top row: Long, thin nerve cells; biconcave red blood cells; curved-rod shaped bacteria. Left to right, bottom row: oval, flagellated algae and round, spiky pollen grains are just a sample of the many shapes.





Vocabulary


axon : A long, slender projection of a neuron that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body.



capillary : The smallest of a body's blood vessels.



dendrite : Branched projections of a neuron; conducts the electrochemical stimulation received from other cells to the cell body.



egg (Latin, ovum) : Cell in which an embryo first begins to develop.



erythrocyte : Flattened, doubly concave cells that carry oxygen; also known as red blood cells.



eukaryotic cell : Typical of multi-celled organisms; have membrane bound organelles; usually larger than prokaryotic cells.



flagella (singular, flagellum ): A "tail-like" appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.



microvilli : Cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area of cells.



neuron : An electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information by electrical and chemical signaling; a nerve cell.



prokaryotic cell : Typical of simple, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria; lack a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles.



structure-function relationship : Principle that states the function of a biological item (molecule, protein, cell) is determined by its structure.





Summary


Cell size is limited by a cell's surface area to volume ratio. A smaller cell is more effective and transporting materials, including waste products, than a larger cell.

Cells come in many different shapes. A cell's function is determined, in part, by its shape.

Common Parts of Cells - Advanced


Identify the parts common to all cells.





What do your cells share with a bacterium?

This bacterial cell has the features all cells have in common-the ribosomes and DNA can be seen floating around in the cytoplasm, which is surrounded by the plasma membrane.





Parts of a Cell


There are many different types of cells, but all cells fall into two general categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic . These cells can be vastly different, but still similar in some ways. All cells, whether from a simple bacterium or a cell from a large whale, have a few things in common. These are:

a cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane)

cytoplasm

ribosomes

DNA (genetic information)



The cell membrane (also called the plasma membrane ) is the physical boundary between the intracellular space (the inside of the cell) and the extracellular environment. It acts almost like the "skin" of the cell, controlling the movement of substances in and out of cells. The cell membrane is semi-permeable , allowing only select ions and organic molecules to enter and/or leave the cell. The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids (a lipid bilayer) with embedded proteins which have numerous functions. More about the cell membrane will be discussed in the The Plasma Membrane (Advanced) concepts.

Cytoplasm is the general term for all of the material inside the cell, excluding the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. All the contents of a prokaryotic cell are contained within the cytoplasm. Cytoplasm is made up of cytosol , a watery fluid that contains cytoskeletal fragments, dissolved particles and organelles. Organelles are structures that carry out specific functions inside the cell. It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many metabolic pathways and processes such as cell division. More about the cytoplasm will be discussed in the Cell Structures: The Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton (Advanced) concept.

Ribosomes are the organelles on which proteins are made during protein synthesis . Ribosomes are found throughout the cytosol of the cell and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum organelle. Ribosomes order amino acids using messenger RNA (mRNA) as a template in a process called translation. Ribosomes are made from complexes of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) and proteins called ribonucleoproteins . Each ribosome is divided into two subunits. The smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern, while the larger subunit binds to the transfer RNA (tRNA) and the growing polypeptide chain. More about the ribosome will be discussed in the Cell Structures: Ribosomes (Advanced) concept.

All cells also have DNA . DNA contains the genetic information needed for building structures such as proteins and RNA molecules in the cell.

An introduction to the cell, discussing various parts of the cell, is available at http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy#p/c/7A9646BC5110CF64/33/Hmwvj9X4GNY (21:03).

Two Types of Cells - Advanced


Define prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Describe common features of prokaryotic cells.

Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.





How many different types of cells are there?

There are many different types of cells. For example, in you there are blood cells and skin cells and bone cells and even bacteria. Here we have drawings of bacteria and animal cells. Can you tell which depicts various types of bacteria? However, all cells - whether from bacteria, human, or any other organism - will be one of two general types: prokaryotic or eukaryotic. In fact, all cells other than bacteria will be one type, and bacterial cells will be the other. And it all depends on how the cell stores its DNA.





Two Types of Cells


There are two cell types: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells are usually single-celled and smaller than eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms, but there are some single-celled eukaryotes.





Prokaryotic Cells




Figure 4.9

Diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell. Among other things, prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. Prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles or a cell nucleus.



The bacterium in Figure above is a prokaryote. Prokaryotes are microscopic organisms that have neither a membrane-bound nucleus nor membrane-bound organelles. Some cell biologists consider the term "organelle" to describe membrane-bound structures only, whereas other cell biologists define organelles as discrete structures that have a specialized function. Prokaryotes have ribosomes, which are not surrounded by a membrane but do have a specialized function, and could therefore be considered organelles. All metabolic functions carried out by a prokaryote take place in the plasma membrane or the cytosol.

Prokaryotes are the smallest types of cells, averaging 2-5μm in diameter. Despite their small size, inside each cell there is chemical and biochemical machinery necessary for growth, reproduction, and the acquisition and utilization of energy. The common features of prokaryotic cells are:

cell wall

plasma membrane

ribosomes

genetic material

capsule (most, but not all)

flagella (most, but not all)

pili (most, but not all)

lack of compartmentalization

plasmid (most, but not all)

binary fission



All prokaryotes have a cell wall that adds structural support, acts as a barrier against outside forces and anchors the whip-like flagella . Some prokaryotes have an extra layer outside their cell wall called a capsule, which protects the cell when it is engulfed by other organisms, assists in retaining moisture, and helps the cell adhere to surfaces and nutrients. Pili are hair-like structures on the surface of the cell that attach to other bacterial cells or surfaces.

Within the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm is not subdivided by membranes into organelles, a lack of compartmentalization that is most evident in the organization of the genetic material. Prokaryotic cells contain only a single circular piece of chromosomal DNA stored in an area called the nucleoid . Some prokaryotes also carry smaller circles of DNA called plasmids . Plasmids are physically separate from, and can replicate independently of, the chromosomal DNA. The genetic information on the plasmids is transferable between cells, allowing prokaryotes to share abilities, such as antibiotic resistance.

Scientists have discovered that plasmids serve as important tools in genetics and biotechnology labs, most commonly for their ability to amplify (make many copies of) or to express particular genes. For example, the pGLO plasmid is a genetically engineered plasmid used in biotechnology as a vector for creating genetically modified organisms. Below is a video that will demonstrate the pGLO transformation.

pGLO Transformation at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI9IXHw0j1U

Reproduction in prokaryotic cells is by binary fission ; a process of growth, enlargement and division. This will be discussed in the Cell Division: Prokaryotic (Advanced) concept.

Prokaryotes have a large array of characteristics, that enable them to withstand different conditions, environments and resources. Some live in the absence of oxygen, some in extreme cold or hot temperatures, and some in the bottom of the ocean where their only resource is hot hydrogen sulfide, bubbling up from the core of the Earth. They are spectacularly resourceful organisms.





Eukaryotic Cells




Figure 4.10

A eukaryotic cell, represented here by a model animal cell is much more complex than a prokaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells contain many organelles that do specific jobs. No single eukaryotic cell has all the organelles shown here, and this model shows all eukaryotic organelles.



A eukaryote is an organism whose cells are organized into complex structures by internal membranes and a cytoskeleton, as shown in Figure above . The most characteristic membrane-bound structure of eukaryotes is the nucleus. This feature gives them their name, which comes from Greek and means "true nucleus." The nucleus is the membrane-enclosed organelle that contains DNA. Eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes . Some eukaryotes are single-celled, but many are multicellular. Eukaryotes include all protists, fungi, plants and animals.

In addition to having a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus and ribosomes, eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles . Each organelle in a eukaryote has a distinct function. Because of their complex level of organization, eukaryotic cells can carry out many more functions than prokaryotic cells. The main differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are shown in Figure below and listed in Table below . Keep in mind that some eukaryotic cells may have characteristics or features that other eukaryotic cells lack, such as the cell wall.



Figure 4.11

The main differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells have membrane bound organelles, shown here as a mitochondria, while prokaryotic cells do not. The nucleoid is the area within the cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell that contains the genetic material.





A Comparison


Eukaryotic cells are about 10 times the size of a typical prokaryote; they range between 10 and 100 µm in diameter while prokaryotes range between 1 and 10 µm in diameter, as shown in Figure below . Scientists believe that eukaryotes developed about 1.6 – 2.1 billion years ago. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms that have been found are 1.2 billion years old.

Viruses - Advanced


Explain why viruses are not considered living organisms.





What is a virus? Is it even a living organism?

This alien-looking thing is a representation of a virus. But is it prokaryotic or eukaryotic? Or neither? Or both? A virus is essentially genetic material surrounded by protein. That's it. So, is a virus prokaryotic or eukaryotic? Or neither? Or both?





Are Viruses Prokaryotic or Eukaryotic?


A virus is a sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells. Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotic organisms. In essence, a virus is simply a nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat, as seen in the Figure below . This outer coat is called a capsid . Viruses will be discussed in more detail in the Viruses concepts.

Are viruses prokaryotic or eukaryotic? Neither. Viruses are not made up of cells, so they do not have a cell membrane or any cytoplasm, ribosomes, or other organelles, nor do they have their own metabolism. The viral DNA (or sometimes RNA) encodes for proteins that make the capsid. However, viruses cannot make their own proteins; they use the ribosomes of a host cell to make proteins. A host cell is a cell infected by a virus.

Viruses do not reproduce by themselves, instead, they use their host cell to make additional copies of themselves. The host cell both replicates the viral genome (DNA) and produces the viral capsid. The viral genome is then packaged into the capsid, resulting in new viruses. So most virologists consider viruses non-living. But, they do evolve, which is a characteristic of living organisms.

Viruses do have significant use in research and medicine, including gene therapy . Understanding the structure of viruses and understanding their interaction with host organisms (including how they infect and exploit host cells to reproduce) and understanding their physiology and immunity is beneficial to human health.

Viruses were first described by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. He described a "non-bacterial pathogen" infecting tobacco plants. This was soon followed by the identification of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898. Since then, about 5,000 viruses have been described in detail, although it is believed that there are millions of different types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth, and are the most abundant type of biological entity. Viruses can be classified with a taxonomic structure from order to species. No kingdom classification exists. Viruses, not being made of cells, do not fall into any of the six prokaryotic or eukaryotic kingdoms.

Cell Structures - Advanced


Describe the cellular structure-function relationship.





What are cell structures?

The contents of the cell, or the structures of the cell, allow the cell to be "specialized." Together with the cell's proteins, they allow the cell to do specific things. They allow a cell to act like a neuron or a bone cell or a skin cell.





Introduction to Cellular Structures


The invention of the microscope opened up a previously unknown world. Before the invention of the microscope, very little was known about what made up living things and non-living things, or where living things came from. During the discovery of cells, spontaneous generation — the belief that living organisms grow directly from decaying organic substances — was the accepted explanation for the appearance of small organisms. For example, people accepted that mice spontaneously appeared in stored grain, and maggots formed in meat with no apparent external influence. Once cells were discovered, the search for answers to such questions as "What are cells made of?" and "What is the function of cells?" became the focus of study.



Figure 4.14

The structure and contents of a typical animal cell. Every animal cell has a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and a nucleus, but not all cells have every structure shown here. For example, some cells such as red blood cells do not have any mitochondria, yet others such as muscle cells may have thousands of mitochondria.





Cell Function


Cells share the same needs: the need to get energy from their environment, the need to respond to their environment, and the need to reproduce. Cells must also be able to separate their relatively stable interior from the ever-changing external environment. They do this by coordinating many processes that are carried out within organelles, or other cellular structures. Structures that are common to many different cells indicate the common history shared by cell-based life. Examples of these common structures include the components of both the cell (or plasma) membrane and the cytoskeleton, and other structures shown in Figure above .

Is there a relationship between the cell structure and its function? Of course there is. The structure-function relationship describes a pattern evident throughout biological systems. This relationship is evident in proteins (protein structure determines its function), nucleic acids (nucleic acid structure results in a genetic code), anatomy (longer necked giraffes are more functional than short neck giraffes), as well as cells. Using the human body as an example, specialized cells perform many diverse functions, from digestion and excretion to message transmission and oxygen distribution. The structure of each type of human cell depends on what function it will perform. This structure-function relationship can be extended to all other organisms, from the largest whale to the smallest bacteria.

The variability between cell function is related to the proteins expressed in a particular type of cell. For example, though they do have many proteins in common, a neuron is going to use select different proteins than muscle cell. A direct relationship exists between the proteins expressed, the size and shape of every cell and the tasks it needs to accomplish. Examples can easily be seen in red blood cells, neurons muscle cells and sperm cells.

Red blood cells are flat, round, and very small. Their small size allows easy maneuverability through the capillaries, the narrowest blood vessels, where oxygen is transferred into body cells.

Neurons have a long, thin cellular extension, allowing for very quick and accurate communication and responses. The long length allows a neuron to send electrical messages extremely quickly.

Skeletal muscle cells have an arrangement of linear protein fibers. The elongated shape allows for muscle contraction.

Sperm cells are the only human cell with flagella . This is because of their need to "swim" long distances to reach an egg for fertilization.





Vocabulary


flagella (singular, flagellum ): A tail-like appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.



neuron : An electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information by electrical and chemical signaling; a nerve cell.



organelle : A structure within the cytoplasm of a cell; may be enclosed within a membrane; performs a specific function.



spontaneous generation : An obsolete principle regarding the origin of life from inanimate matter.



structure-function relationship : Principle that states the function of a biological item (molecule, protein, cell) is determined by its structure.





Summary


A cell's function is usually directly related to its structure; this is known as the structure-function relationship.

The structure-function relationship is evident throughout biology.

The Plasma Membrane - Advanced


Outline the structure of the plasma membrane.





All cells have a plasma membrane. This membrane surrounds the cell. So what is its role?

Can molecules enter and leave the cell? Yes. Can anything or everything enter or leave? No. So, what determines what can go in or out? Is it the nucleus? The DNA? Or the plasma membrane?





Plasma Membrane


The plasma membrane (also called the cell membrane ) is a lipid bilayer that is common to all living cells. Its function is to keep the cell as a distinct entity in a water-based environment. A phospholipid bilayer is a double layer of closely-packed phospholipid molecules. It is this orientation of the phospholipids into the bilayer that biochemically gives the membrane its specific functional characteristics.

Organelle membranes are also composed of phospholipids. For example, mitochondria are bounded by a double membrane. Each membrane has a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. This division from the rest of the cell makes the mitochondria only partially dependent on the cell. More on the structure of the phospholipid bilayer will be presented in the The Plasma Membrane: The Phospholipid Bilayer (Advanced) concept.

Along the phospholipid bilayer, numerous proteins are embedded within the membrane. This structure is called the Fluid Mosaic Model which will be discussed in the The Plasma Membrane: The Fluid Mosaic Model (Advanced) concept. These proteins have a variety of important roles; hormone binding sites, electron carriers, pumps for active transport, channels for passive transport, enzymes, cell signaling and cell adhesion.

The plasma membranes allows only certain molecules, such as ions and small organic molecules, into and out of the cell. The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability . This characteristic helps the cell to regulate its interactions between the internal machinery and the external surroundings, helping to maintain homeostasis.

The plasma membrane also acts as the attachment point for both the intracellular cytoskeleton and, if present, the cell wall.

The plasma membrane is discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ug5Vf_lxtI . The video is below.

The Phospholipid Bilayer - Advanced


Describe the structure and function of the plasma membrane.





Why a bilayer?

What's on the inside of the cell and on the outside? Mostly water. As you can see here, the water-based interior of the cell has lots of components. These need to be kept inside the cell. And it is the nature of the phospholipid bilayer to keep the inside of the cell separate from the outside.





Phospholipids


The cell membrane (or plasma membrane ) is composed mainly of phospholipids with embedded proteins. The membrane is a lipid bilayer, with the phospholipids oriented in a distinct manner to provide qualities necessary to maintain a cell in a water-based environment.

A phospholipid is made up of a polar, phosphorus-containing head, and two long fatty acid (hydrocarbon), non-polar "tails." That is, the head of the molecule is hydrophilic (water-loving), and the tail is hydrophobic (water-fearing). Cytosol and extracellular fluid - the insides and outsides of the cell - are made up of mostly water. In this watery environment, the water loving heads point out towards the water, and the water fearing tails point inwards, and push the water out. The resulting double layer is called a phospholipid bilayer. A phospholipid bilayer is made up of two layers of phospholipids, in which hydrophobic fatty acids are in the middle of the plasma membrane, and the hydrophilic heads are on the outside. An example of a simple phospholipid bilayer is illustrated in Figure below .



Figure 4.15

Phospholipid Bilayer. The phospholipid bilayer consists of two layers of phospholipids, with a hydrophobic, or water-hating, interior and a hydrophilic, or water-loving, exterior. The hydrophilic (polar) head group and hydrophobic tails (fatty acid chains) are depicted in the single phospholipid molecule. The polar head group and fatty acid chains are attached by a 3-carbon glycerol unit. The hydrophobic fatty acids point towards the middle of the plasma membrane, and the hydrophilic heads point outwards. The membrane is stabilized by cholesterol molecules (green). This self-organization of phospholipids results in a semipermeable membrane which allows only certain molecules in or out of the cell.



The cell membrane also decides what may enter or leave a cell. The membrane is said to be semipermeable or selectively permeable, allowing only certain ions and organic molecules to cross the membrane. The plasma membrane contain many proteins, as well as other lipids called sterols. The proteins have various functions, such as channels (channel proteins) that allow certain molecules into the cell, and receptors (receptor proteins) that bind to signal molecules. In Figure above , the smaller (green) molecules shown between the phospholipids are cholesterol molecules. Cholesterol helps keep the plasma membrane firm and stable over a wide range of temperatures. At least ten different types of lipids are commonly found in plasma membranes. Each type of cell or organelle will have a different percentage of each lipid, protein and carbohydrate.





Vocabulary


cholesterol : A steroid alcohol that is present in animal cells and body fluids, regulates membrane fluidity, and functions as a precursor molecule in various metabolic pathways.



hydrophilic : Characteristic of the phospholipid head group; water-loving.



hydrophobic : Characteristic of the phospholipid tails; water-hating.



phospholipid : A major component of the cell membrane; consists of two hydrophobic tails and a hydrophilic phosphate head group.



phospholipid bilayer : A bilayer (2 layers) of phospholipids that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment.



plasma membrane : Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the cell membrane.





Summary


A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a polar head group ( a phosphate group) and two non-polar hydrocarbon tails.

The plasma membrane is a selectively permeable lipid bilayer that contains mostly lipids and proteins. These lipids and proteins are involved in many cellular processes.

Membrane Proteins - Advanced


Describe the structures and roles of proteins associated with the cell membrane.





Membrane Proteins


The second main component of plasma membranes are the variety of proteins. A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle. Membrane proteins can be put into two groups based on how the protein is associated with the membrane: (1) integral membrane proteins and (2) peripheral membrane proteins.

Integral membrane proteins , also called intrinsic proteins, are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane. Structurally, the integral proteins contain residues with hydrophobic side chains that penetrate the fatty acyl regions of the phospholipid bilayer, thus anchoring the protein to the membrane. The only way to remove the integral proteins from the membrane are with synthetic detergents, nonpolar solvents and denaturing agents that disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of the bilayer.

Integral membrane proteins can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer:

Transmembrane proteins span the entire plasma membrane. Their function is mainly to regulate the transport of specific molecules across the membrane. There are two basic types of transmembrane proteins, alpha-helical and beta-barrels, which are discussed in Organic Compounds: Proteins (Advanced) .

Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side.



Examples of integral membrane proteins and their functions are:

glycoprotein (cell-to-cell interactions)

Na+/K+ ATPase (responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Sodium and Potassium ions across the plasma membrane)

glucose permease (the reversible transporter protein of glucose)

ion channels & gates (the flow of ions across the cell membrane)

gap junction proteins (a direct connection between the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules and ions to pass freely between cells)

Bacterial rhodopsins (a protein in archaeans that uses the energy of light to pump protons across the membrane)



Peripheral membrane proteins , also called extrinsic proteins, are only temporarily associated with the membrane. Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic so usually they are either attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can directly bound to a polar head group of the bilayer. This way they can be easily removed, which allows them to be involved in cell signaling. Peripheral membrane proteins are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors.

Examples of peripheral membrane proteins and their functions are:

spectrin (links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton for determination of cell shape, arrangement of transmembrane proteins, and organization of organelles)

Kinase C (enzyme that helps mediate signal transduction cascades by hydrolyzing lipids)

phospholipases (hydrolyze various bonds in the the polar head group of phospholipids which are vital to the degredation of damaged or aged cell membranes)

hormone receptors (binds a hormone outside the cell membrane and activates a protein kinase inside the cell)



Glycoproteins and glycolipids, in particular, have a carbohydrate chain that acts as a label to identify the cell type. Specifically, A, B, O blood groups result from having different carbohydrate chains on the cell surface of red blood cells and other types of cells. Everyone has glycolipids and glycoproteins with the particular type of carbohydrate chain that signals type O. However, people with type A also have an additional carbohydrate called N-Acetylgalactosamine and those with type B have an added galactose. Those with type AB have some glycolipids and glycoproteins with N-Acetylgalactosamine added and others with galactose added.

Shown in Figure below are two different types of membrane proteins and associated molecules.



Figure 4.16

Some of the membrane proteins make up a major transport system that moves molecules and ions through the polar phospholipid bilayer.





Vocabulary


integral membrane proteins : Proteins that are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane of a cell or organelle.



membrane protein : A protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with, the membrane of a cell or organelle.



peripheral membrane proteins : Proteins that are only temporarily associated with the cell membrane; can be easily removed.



plasma membrane : Thin coat of lipids (phospholipids) that surrounds and encloses a cell; physical boundary between the intracellular space and the extracellular environment; also called the cell membrane.





Summary


The plasma membrane has many proteins that assist other substances in crossing the membrane.

Membrane proteins may be permanently attached/embedded (integral membrane proteins) to the membrane, or just temporarily associated with the membrane (peripheral membrane proteins).

The Fluid Mosaic Model - Advanced


Describe the Fluid Mosaic Model of the plasma membrane.





Fluid and mosaic?

In this artistic impression of a plasma membrane of a human cell, the plasma membrane is shown as a bilayer composed of phospholipids with transmembrane and surface proteins. The phospholipids create a fluid environment full of a mosaic of proteins.





The Fluid Mosaic Model


In 1972, S. J. Singer and G. L. Nicolson proposed the now widely accepted Fluid Mosaic Model of the structure of cell membranes ( Science, 175: 720-731). Remember, it is the cell membrane that keeps the cell's internal environment separate from its surroundings, but it is also this membrane that constantly and consistently allows the cell to interact and exchange materials with its environment.

The Fluid Mosaic Model proposes that integral membrane proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer , as seen in the opening image. The bilayer results from the chemical nature of the phospholipids in a polar environment. The phospholipids create a double layer - or bilayer - when placed in a polar environment like water. Some of these proteins associated with the membrane extend all the way through the bilayer, and some only partially across it. In this model, the integral membrane proteins have their polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous environment, while the non polar regions of the protein are buried within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

This model also proposed that the membrane behaves like a fluid. Scanning electron microscope images demonstrated that the embedded molecules can move sideways throughout the membrane, meaning the membrane is not solid, but more like a fluid. The membrane proteins and lipids of the membrane can move laterally around the membrane, much like buoys in water, or sideways throughout the membrane. Such movement causes a constant change in the "mosaic pattern" of the plasma membrane. The mosaic pattern results from the many different components of the bilayer. These components include the phospholipids, integral and peripheral proteins, glycoproteins and glycolipids, which aid in their location and identification of food, water, waste, and other membrane traffic. Each cell has a particular glycoprotein structure extruding from the cell membrane, based on its need to attract or repel membrane traffic. The cell is constantly interacting with its environment, bring certain molecules such as ions, hormones and food into the cell, and exporting materials, such as wastes, out of the cell.

A further description of the fluid mosaic model can be viewed in Fluid Mosaic Model of the Cell Membrane at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKN5sq5dtW4 (1:27).

The Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton - Advanced


Distinguish cytoplasm from cytosol.

Name and describe three types of protein fibers that make up the cytoskeleton.





Does a cell have, or even need, a "skeleton"?

What do you get if you take some tubing, and make the tubes smaller and smaller and smaller? You get very small tubes, or microtubes. Very small tubes, or microtubules, together with microfilaments, form the basis of the "skeleton" inside the cell.





Cytoplasm


Cytoplasm is one component of cells that is common to all cells. Cytoplasm is the gel-like material between the cell membrane and the nucleus. The cytoplasm plays an important role in a cell, serving as a "jelly" in which organelles are suspended and held together by the cell membrane. Though prokaryotic cells do not have organelles (though they do have ribosomes), they still have cytoplasm. It is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, including the many metabolic pathways that occur within organelles, such as photosynthesis and aerobic respiration.

The cytosol , which is the watery substance that does not contain organelles, is made up of 80% to 90% water. The cytosol plays a mechanical role by exerting pressure against the cell’s plasma membrane. This helps keep the shape of the cell. Cytosol also acts as the site of biochemical reactions such as anaerobic glycolysis and protein synthesis. In prokaryotes all chemical reactions take place in the cytosol.





Cytoskeleton


The cytoskeleton is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. All eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton, and recent research has shown that prokaryotic cells also have a cytoskeleton. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is made up of a network of long, thin protein fibers and has many functions. It helps to maintain cell shape, holds organelles in place, and for some cells, it enables cell movement. The cytoskeleton plays important roles in both the intracellular movement of substances and in cell division. Certain proteins act like a path that vesicles and organelles move along within the cell. The threadlike proteins that make up the cytoskeleton continually rebuild to adapt to the cell's constantly changing needs. Three main kinds of cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.

Microtubules , shown as (a) in Figure below , are hollow cylinders and are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures. They are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin, and radiate outwards from an area near the nucleus called the centrosome. Tubulin is the protein that forms microtubules. Two forms of tubulin, alpha and beta, form dimers (pairs) which come together to form the hollow cylinders. The cylinders are twisted around each other to form the microtubules. Microtubules help the cell keep its shape. They hold organelles in place and allow them to move around the cell, and they form the mitotic spindle during cell division. Microtubules also make up parts of cilia and flagella, the organelles that help a cell move.

Microfilaments , shown as (b) in Figure below , are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another. Microfilaments are mostly concentrated just beneath the cell membrane, where they support the cell and help the cell keep its shape. Microfilaments form cytoplasmatic extentions, such as pseudopodia and microvilli , which allow certain cells to move. The actin of the microfilaments interacts with the protein myosin to cause contraction in muscle cells. Microfilaments are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape, such as phagocytes (white blood cells that search the body for bacteria and other invaders).

Intermediate filaments differ in make-up from one cell type to another. Intermediate filaments organize the inside structure of the cell by holding organelles and providing strength. They are also structural components of the nuclear envelope. Intermediate filaments made of the protein keratin are found in skin, hair, and nails cells.

By linking regions of the cell together, the cytoskeleton helps support the shape of the cell. (b) Microscopy of microfilaments (actin filaments), shown in green, inside cells.

The cytoskeleton is a cellular "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. Three main cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments.

Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures and are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin.

Microfilament are the thinnest of the cytoskeleton structures and are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another.

External Structures of Cells - Advanced


Distinguish between cilia and flagella.





What propels a bacteria along?

Bacteria, being single-celled organisms, cannot just get up and walk from place to place. So they have to "swim." To do this, they must have some sort of structure that propels them through their environment. Such a tail-like structure is a flagellum or set of flagella. These protein containing structures spin around a biological motor, allowing the bacteria to move.





External Structures of the Cell


Flagella ( flagellum , singular) are long, thin structures that protrude from the cell membrane. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can have flagella. Flagella help single-celled organisms move or swim towards food. The flagella of eukaryotic cells are normally used for movement too, such as in the movement of sperm cells, which have only a single flagellum. The flagella of either group are very different from each other. Prokaryotic flagella, shown in Figure below , are spiral-shaped and stiff. They spin around in a fixed base much like a screw does, which moves the cell in a tumbling fashion. Eukaryotic flagella are made of microtubules that bend and flex like a whip.



Figure 4.18

Bacterial flagella spin about in place, which causes the bacterial cell to "tumble."



Cilia ( cilium , singular) are made up of microtubule containing extensions of the cell membrane. Although both cilia and flagella are used for movement, cilia are much shorter than flagella. Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled organisms, such as paramecium. Their cilia beat together to move the little animal-like protists through the water. In multicellular animals, including humans, cilia are usually found in large numbers on a single surface of cells. Multicellular animals' cilia usually move materials inside the body. For example, the mucociliary escalator of the respiratory system is made up of mucus-secreting ciliated cells that line the trachea and bronchi. These ciliated cells, shown in Figure below , move mucus away from the lungs. This mucus catches spores, bacteria, and debris and moves to the esophagus, where it is swallowed.

A video showing flagella and cilia can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGAm6hMysTA (3:12).

Note how there are nine groups of two microtubules (called dimers) in each cilium. Each dimer is made up of an alpha and a beta tubulin protein that are connected together.





Vocabulary


cilia (singular, cilium ): Short, hairlike projection, similar to flagella, that allows some cells to move.



flagella (singular, flagellum ): A "tail-like" appendage that protrudes from the cell body of certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; used for locomotion.



microtubules : Largest component of the cytoskeleton; hollow protein cylinders made of alpha and beta tubulin; also found in flagella.





Summary


Cilia and flagella are extensions of the cell membrane that contain microtubules, and are usually used for movement.

Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled animals, such as paramecium, but cover only one side of cells in some multicellular organisms.

The Nucleus - Advanced


Outline the form and function of the nucleus.





Where does the DNA live?

The answer depends on if the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The main difference between the two types of cells is the presence of a nucleus. In eukaryotic cells, DNA lives in the nucleus.





The Nucleus


The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. The nucleus is the largest organelle in the cell and contains most of the cell's genetic information (mitochondria also contain DNA, called mitochondrial DNA, but it makes up just a small percentage of the cell’s overall DNA content). The genetic information, which contains the information for the structure and function of the organism, is found encoded in DNA in the form of genes. A gene is a short segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a protein strand. DNA in the nucleus is organized in long linear strands that are attached to different proteins. These proteins help the DNA to coil up for better storage in the nucleus. Think how a string gets tightly coiled up if you twist one end while holding the other end. These long strands of coiled-up DNA and proteins are called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains many genes. Humans have about 20,000 to 22,000 genes scattered among 23 chromosomes.

Essentially, the nucleus is the control center of the cell. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of the genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression. Gene expression is the process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" by various cell molecules to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein molecule or an RNA molecule. Gene expression is a highly regulated process, ensuring RNA and proteins are only produced when necessary.

The degree of DNA coiling determines whether the chromosome strands are short and thick or long and thin. Between cell divisions, the DNA in chromosomes is more loosely coiled and forms long thin strands called chromatin . DNA is in this uncoiled form during the majority of the cell cycle, making the DNA available to the proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription. Before the cell divides, the chromatin coils up more tightly and form chromosomes. Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to be seen under a microscope. The word chromosome comes from the Greek word chroma (color), and soma (body) due to its ability to be stained strongly by dyes.





Nuclear Envelope


The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material. It separates the contents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two phospholipid bilayers, an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.





Nucleolus


The nucleus of many cells also contains an organelle called a nucleolus , shown in Figure below . The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA, called mRNA for messenger RNA, into amino acids. After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they direct protein synthesis.



Figure 4.20

The eukaryotic cell nucleus. Visible in this diagram are the ribosome-studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (as chromatin), and the nucleolus. Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus. The chromatin (which is normally invisible), is visible in this figure only to show that it is spread out throughout the nucleus.





Vocabulary


chromatin : Grainy material form of uncoiled DNA; form of DNA during interphase of the cell cycle.



chromosome : The coiled structure of DNA and histone proteins; allows for the precise separation of replicated DNA; forms during prophase of mitosis and meiosis.



gene : A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.



gene expression : The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.



nuclear envelope : Double phospholipid membrane of the nucleus; encloses the genetic material.



nuclear pore : Tiny hole in the nuclear envelope.



nucleolus : Section of the nucleus; site of ribosome assembly.



nucleus (plural, nuclei ): The membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells that contains the genetic material (DNA); control center of the cell.



ribosome : A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).





Summary


The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle, found in most eukaryotic cells, which stores the genetic material (DNA).

The nucleus is surrounded by a double lipid bilayer, the nuclear envelope, which is embedded with nuclear pores.

The nucleolus is inside the nucleus, and is where ribosomes are made.

The Mitochondria - Advanced


Outline the form and function of the mitochondria.





Sperm cells and muscle cells need lots of energy. What do they have in common?

They have lots of mitochondria. Mitochondria are called the power plants of the cell, as these organelles are where most of the cell's energy is produced. Cells that need lots of energy have lots of mitochondria.





The Mitochondria


A mitochondrion ( mitochondria , plural), is a membrane-enclosed organelle that is found in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are called the "power plants" of the cell because they are the site of cellular respiration. In cellular respiration, the energy from organic compounds such as glucose, is used to make ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ). ATP is the cell's energy source that is used for such things such as movement and cell division. Some ATP is made in the cytosol of the cell, but most of it is made inside mitochondria. The number of mitochondria in a cell depends on the cell’s energy needs. For example, active human muscle cells may have thousands of mitochondria, while less active red blood cells do not have any.





5 Compartments


As the Figure below (a) and (b) shows, a mitochondrion has two phospholipids membranes. The smooth outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol. The inner membrane has many folds, called cristae . These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area for integral proteins. Many proteins involved in cellular respiration are embedded in this inner membrane. The greater surface area allows more proteins to be located there, resulting in more cellular respiration reactions, and more ATP synthesis. ATP is produced by the enzyme ATP synthase, which is a membrane protein of the mitochondria inner membrane. The fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrian, called matrix , is where most of the cell’s ATP is made.



Figure 4.21

(a): Electron micrograph of a single mitochondrion within which you can see many cristae. Mitochondria range from 1 to 10 μm in size. (b): This model of a mitochondrian shows the organized arrangement of the outer membrane and folded inner membrane with cristae, the inter membrane space, the mitochondrial matrix, and ATP synthase protein complex.



The mitochondria essentially has five compartments, each with its own function:

the outer mitochondrial membrane,

the intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes),

the inner mitochondrial membrane,

the cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and

the matrix (space within the inner membrane).



The outer membrane contains large numbers of integral proteins called porins . These porins form channels that allow small molecules to freely diffuse across the membrane to the other. The inner mitochondrial membrane is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. ATP synthase , which produces ATP in the matrix, is embedded within this membrane. The cristae greatly expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, enhancing the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP. The matrix contains a highly-concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, the mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNAs, and several copies of the mitochondrial genome. Of the enzymes, the Krebs cycle enzymes are located here.





Mitochondria Genome


Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondria also have the machinery to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins. The human mitochondrial DNA sequence has 16,569 base pairs encoding 37 total genes: 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 13 peptide genes. The 13 mitochondrial peptides in humans are integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane, along with proteins encoded by nuclear genes.

Mitochondria are able to reproduce asexually, like bacteria, and scientists think that they are descended from prokaryotic organisms. According to the Theory of Endosymbiosis , mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes that infected other prokaryotic cells. The invading prokaryotes were protected inside the host cell, and in turn the prokaryote supplied extra ATP to its host. Eventually these two cells turned into one eukaryotic cell, as the two organisms evolved so that they could no longer live without each other. Over time, the ancient internal prokaryote turned into an organelle, resulting in a large cell with an internal organelle. By definition, this is an eukaryotic cell.

Unlike nuclear DNA which is inherited from the father and mother, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA is most often inherited from mothers. However paternal mtDNA occasionally slips through with sperm. The technical process is still unclear but a study was down using Caenorhabditis elegans that showed double membrane vesicles, called autophagosomes, engulf paternal mitochondria and destroy them.

Since mothers provide the mtDNA and fathers will never pass on a mtDNA, a child shares the same or similar mtDNA sequence as does his/her siblings and mother. This direct inheritance has allowed biologists to track the origin of modern human and to draw maternal lineages.

Unfortunately, maternal mt(DNA)is susceptible to mutations which are a cause of inherited disease, such as breast cancer. Although, it is important to note that most mutations do not lead to defected mtDNA. Heteroplasmy is the presence of a mixture of more than one type of mtDNA. Most people have homoplasmic cells, meaning that their cells contain only normal, undefected mtDNA. However, people with both normal, undefected mtDNA and not normal, defected mtDNA, may inherit mitochondrial diseases. The ultimate condition leading to disease is when the proportion of mutant mtDNA reaches a threshold, after which the cell can no longer cope, resulting in disease. This threshold varies among different tissues and different mutations.

Endoplasmic Reticulum - Advanced


Outline the form and function of the endoplasmic reticulum.





Does a cell have its own ER?

Yes, but in this case, the ER is not just for emergencies. True, there might be times when the cell responds to emergency conditions and the functions of the ER may be needed, but usually the cell's ER is involved in normal functions. Proteins are also made on the outside of the ER, and this starts a whole process of protein transport, both around the inside of the cell and to the cell membrane and out.





The Endoplasmic Reticulum


The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (plural, reticuli ) is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, flattened sheets, and round sacs. These flattened, hollow folds and sacs are called cisternae . The membrane of the ER is continuous with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. The ER has two major functions:

Transport : Molecules, such as proteins, can move from place to place inside the ER, much like on an intracellular highway.

Synthesis : Ribosomes that are attached to ER, similar to unattached ribosomes, make proteins. Lipids are also produced in the ER.



There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).

Rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes which gives it a "rough" sandpaper-like appearance. The ribosomes on the RER make proteins that are then transported from the ER in small phospholipid sacs called transport vesicles . The transport vesicles pinch off the ends of the ER. These vesicles can easily shuttle proteins between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. The RER works with the Golgi apparatus to move new proteins to their proper destinations in the cell or to the cell membrane. Proteins that are made on the RER are inserted directly into the ER and then are transported to their various cellular destinations, including the cell membrane.



Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not have any ribosomes attached to it, and so it has a smooth appearance. SER has many different functions some of which are: lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, calcium ion storage, steroid metabolism and drug detoxification. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in both animal and plant cells and it serves different functions in each. The SER is made up of tubules and vesicles that branch out to form a network. In some cells there are dilated areas like the sacs of RER. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and RER form an interconnected network of membranous cisternae, tubules and vesicles.





Figure 4.22

Image of nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and how they work together. The process of secretion from endoplasmic reticuli (orange) to Golgi apparatus (pink) is shown.





Protein Transport


The ER plays a significant role in protein transport. Proteins are transported through the ER and then throughout the cell are marked with a signal sequence. This sequence is usually a short peptide of a few amino acids attached to the N-terminal end of the protein. This short sequence acts as an address "tag," directing the protein to its correct destination in the cell. At this time, the signal sequence is removed. These proteins packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination.





Vocabulary


cisternae (singular, cisterna ): Flattened membranous regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.



endoplasmic reticulum (ER) : A network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, cisternae, and vesicles; involved in transport of molecules, such as proteins, and the synthesis of proteins and lipids.



rough endoplasmic reticulum : Endoplasmic reticulum embedded with ribosomes.



smooth endoplasmic reticulum : Endoplasmic reticulum without embedded ribosomes.



transport vesicle : A vesicle that is able to move molecules between locations inside the cell.





Summary


The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, cisternae, and vesicles.

The ER is involved in transport of molecules, such as proteins, and the synthesis of proteins and lipids.

The ER can be rough, with embedded ribosomes, or smooth, without ribosomes.





Review


What are the main structural and functional differences between rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum?





Ribosomes - Advanced


Outline the form and function of ribosomes.





Where are proteins made?

Proteins are made on ribosomes. The chemical structure of a ribosome is shown above. A ribosome is an organelle made out of just protein and RNA. Its role in protein synthesis is extremely important. And it is the structure of the ribosome that allows it to function as it does.





Ribosomes


Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis (translation). Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm. They can also be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, and others are attached to the nuclear envelope. Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane.

Translation is the process of ordering the amino acids in the assembly of a protein. The word ribosome comes from ribo nucleic acid and the Greek soma (meaning body). Two Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work relating to the ribosome. The 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Albert Claude, Christian de Duve and George Emil Palade for the discovery of the ribosome, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for discovering the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome.

Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions, such as translation. Ribosomes, which are just made out of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and protein, have been classified as ribozymes , because the rRNA has enzymatic activity. The rRNA is important for the peptidyl transferase activity that bonds amino acids. Briefly, the ribosomes interact with other RNA molecules to make chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains, due to the peptide bond that forms between individual amino acids. Inside the ribosome, three sites participate in the translation process, the A, P and E sites. Translation will be discussed in detail the Protein Synthesis: Translation (Advanced) concept.





Ribosome Structure


Ribosomes from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, have significantly different structures and RNA sequences. The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells significantly resemble those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.

Ribosomes are produced in the nucleolus, and then transported to the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are made of ribosomal proteins, called ribonucleoproteins , and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in Figure below . The subunits are attached to each other. During translation, the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA, while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA with attached amino acids. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, the two ribosomal subunits disassociate.



Figure 4.23

The two subunits that make up a ribosome, small organelles that are intercellular protein factories.



The two ribosomal subunits are named base on their sedmentation rate in a centrifuge. The unit of measurement is the Svedberg unit , a measure of the rate of sedimentation, not the size. This accounts for why fragment names do not add up (70S is made of 50S and 30S).

Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit. Their small subunit has a 16S RNA subunit (consisting of 1540 nucleotides) bound to 21 proteins. The large subunit is composed of a 5S RNA subunit (120 nucleotides), a 23S RNA subunit (2900 nucleotides) and 31 proteins.

Eukaryotes have 80S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (40S) and large (60S) subunit. Their 40S subunit has an 18S RNA (1900 nucleotides) and 33 proteins. The large subunit is composed of a 5S RNA (120 nucleotides), 28S RNA (4700 nucleotides), a 5.8S RNA (160 nucleotides) subunits and about 49 proteins.

The ribosomes found in chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes also consist of large and small subunits bound together with proteins into one 70S particle. These organelles are believed to be descendants of bacteria and as such their ribosomes are similar to those of bacteria.





Vocabulary


ribonucleoprotein : A nucleoprotein that contains RNA; includes the ribosome, vault ribonucleoproteins, and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs).



ribosome : A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).



ribozyme : An RNA molecule with a tertiary structure that enables it to catalyze a chemical reaction.



Svedberg unit : A non-SI unit for sedimentation rate; technically a measure of time that offers a measure of particle size; 10 -13 seconds (100 fs).



translation : The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.





Summary


Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis. They are found in all cells.

Ribosomes are composed of a large and small subunit. Prtokaryotic ane eukaryotic ribosomal subunits differ in size.

The Golgi Apparatus - Advanced


Outline the form and function of the Golgi apparatus.





Why balloons?

The Golgi apparatus is said to look like a stack of deflated balloons. In essence, that is what the Golgi apparatus is. Not balloons, but plasma membrane. The Golgi apparatus is a series of stacks of membrane, with some extremely important functions.





The Golgi Apparatus


The Golgi apparatus , which is also known as the Golgi complex or Golgi body, is a large organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. It was identified in 1898 by the Italian physician Camillo Golgi.

The Golgi apparatus is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered stacks of discs called cisternae (singular, cisterna ), as shown in Figure below . Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus. A typical mammalian cell will have 40 to 80 of these stacks. While plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In plants, the Golgi apparatus contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides.

The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels "items" and then sends them to different parts of the cell. The Golgi apparatus tends to be larger and more numerous in cells that synthesize and secrete large quantities of materials; for example, the plasma B cells and the antibody-secreting cells of the immune system have prominent Golgi complexes.

The stack of cisternae has four functional regions: the cis-Golgi network, medial-Golgi, endo-Golgi, and trans-Golgi network. Vesicles from the ER fuse with the network and subsequently progress through the stack from the cis- to the trans-Golgi network, where they are packaged and sent to their destination. Each cisterna includes special Golgi enzymes which modify or help to modify proteins that travel through it. Proteins may be modified by the addition of a carbohydrate group (glycosylation) or phosphate group (phosphorylation). These modifications may form a signal sequence on the protein, which determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the addition of a mannose-6-phosphate signals the protein for lysosomes.



Figure 4.24

This animal cell depicts the Golgi apparatus as a stack of flattened discs. The nucleus with the adjacent endoplasmic reticulum, and numerous mitochondria are also easily identifiable.





The Endomembrane System


Together with the ER and transport vesicles, the Golgi apparatus is part of the cell's endomembrane system, which transports molecules around the cell. This system transports molecules, such as proteins, in vesicles. The vesicles that leave the RER are transported to the cis face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the Golgi membrane and empty their contents into the lumen. Once inside the lumen, the molecules are modified, then sorted for transport to their next destinations. In addition to the ER, Golgi apparatus, the endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vacuoles, vesicles, peroxisomes and the cell membrane.

Those proteins destined for areas of the cell other than the ER or Golgi apparatus are moved towards the trans face of the Golgi complex, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known as the trans-Golgi network (TGN) . This area of the Golgi is the point at which proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending upon the molecular signal they carry.



Figure 4.25

Vocabulary


cisternae (singular, cisterna ): Flattened membranous regions of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.



endomembrane system : Divide the cell into functional and structural compartments (organelles); composed of the different membranes that are suspended in the cytoplasm within a eukaryotic cell; includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles, vesicles, peroxisomes and the cell membrane.



Golgi apparatus : A large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae; modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.



trans-Golgi network (TGN) : A major sorting pathway that directs newly synthesized proteins to different subcellular destinations.





Summary


The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae.

The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell.

Vesicles and Vacuoles - Advanced


Outline the form and function of organelles.





What's a little ball of plasma membrane?

A vesicle. Because vesicles are made of phospholipids, they can break off of and fuse with other membraneous material. This allows them to serve as small transport containers, moving substances around the cell and to the cell membrane.





Vesicles


A vesicle is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer. Many vesicles are made in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane by endocytosis. Vesicles can also fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents to the outside. This process is called exocytosis. In addition to the Golgi apparatus and ER, vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell.

Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in Figure below . Because a vesicle is essentially a small organelle, the space inside the vesicle can be chemically different from the cytosol. It is within the vesicles that the cell can perform various metabolic activities, as well as transport and store molecules.



Figure 4.26

Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in this figure.





Types of Vesicles


Vesicles can be classified by their contents and function.

Transport vesicles are part of the endomembrane system. They are able to move molecules such as proteins between locations inside the cell. For example, transport vesicles move proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.



Lysosomes are vesicles that are formed by the Golgi apparatus. They contain powerful enzymes that could break down (digest) the cell. Lysosomes break down harmful cell products, waste materials, and cellular debris and then force them out of the cell. They also digest invading organisms such as bacteria. Lysosomes also break down cells that are ready to die, a process called autolysis.



Peroxisomes are vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic substances in the cell. Unlike lysosomes, which are formed by the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes self-replicate by growing bigger and then dividing. They are common in liver and kidney cells that break down harmful substances. Peroxisomes are named for the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) that is produced when they break down organic compounds. Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and in turn is broken down into water (H 2 O) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules.



Secretory Vesicles contain materials that are to be excreted from the cell, such as wastes or hormones . Secretory vesicles include synaptic vesicles and vesicles in endocrine tissues. Synaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters. They are located at presynaptic terminals in neurons. When a signal reaches the end of an axon, the synaptic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic junction, and binds to a receptor on the next cell. Some cells also produce molecules, such as hormones produced by endocrine tissues, needed by other cells. These molecules are stored in secretory vesicles and released when needed. Secretory vesicles also hold enzymes needed to make extracellular structures, such as the extracellular matrix of animal cells.





Vesicles and Transport


Most vesicles are involved in transporting some sort of molecule, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter. These vesicles must first form around the substance being transported. This requires numerous vesicle coats to surround and bind to the proteins being transported. They also trap various transmembrane receptor proteins, called cargo receptors, which in turn trap the cargo molecules.





The Vesicle Coat


The vesicle coat selects specific proteins as cargo. It selects cargo proteins by binding to sorting signals. These complexes cluster in the membrane, forming a vesicle buds, or coated pit . There are three types of vesicle coats: clathrin , COPI and COPII. Clathrin coats are found on vesicles trafficking between the Golgi and plasma membrane, the Golgi and endosomes, and the plasma membrane and endosomes. COPI ( coat protein complex) coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the cis -Golgi to the ER (retrograde transport), while COPII coated vesicles are responsible for transport from the ER to the Golgi (anterograde transport). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors aggregate in clathrin coated pits prior to internalization.





SNAREs


The vesicle fuses to the membrane phospholipids to release its materials. This process is mediated by a class of proteins known as SNAREs , for Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors. SNAREs are divided into two categories, depending on their location. Vesicle or v-SNAREs are incorporated into the membranes of transport vesicles, and target or t-SNAREs are located in the membranes of target compartments. The v-SNAREs identify the vesicle's cargo, while the t-SNAREs on the target membrane cause the fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane.





Vesicle Fusion


For a vesicle to release its contents to a cell organelle or to the outside of the cell, the vesicle and target membrane must fuse. This process is called vesicle fusion. Fusion between the vesicle and a target membrane occurs in one of two ways: full fusion or "kiss-and-run" fusion. In a full fusion process, the vesicle phospholipids fully incorporate into the plasma membrane. The vesicle can only be reformed and by a clathrin-coat-dependent process. With kiss-and-run fusion, the vesicle reforms after the release of its material. This allows the rapid release of materials from a synaptic vesicle. In this type of fusion, the vesicle forms a fusion pore or porosome in the presynaptic membrane and releases its neurotransmitters across the synapse, after which the vesicle reforms, allowing it to be reused.





Vacuoles


Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles that can have secretory, excretory, and storage functions. Vacuoles are usually much larger than vesicles. Many organisms will use vacuoles as storage areas and some plant cells have very large vacuoles. The large central vacuole of the plant cell is used for osmotic control (storage of water) and nutrient storage. Contractile vacuoles are found in certain protists. These vacuoles take water from the cytoplasm and excrete it from the cell to avoid bursting due to osmotic pressure.

Other Structures of Cells - Advanced


Outline the form and function of cellular structures.





How are chromosomes separated during cell division?

They are pulled apart by spindle fibers. The fibers are made of microtubules and are organized by the centrioles. Two pairs of centrioles are seen on opposite sides of the cell during prophase, the first phase of mitosis.





Centrioles


Centrioles are rod-like structures made of short microtubules. Though they are found in most eukaryotic cells, centrioles are absent in some plants and most fungi.

Nine groups of three microtubules (nine triplets) make up each centriole. The nine triplets are arranged in a cartwheel-like orientation. Two perpendicularly placed centrioles make up the centrosome . Centrioles are very important in cellular division, where they arrange the mitotic spindles that pull the chromosome apart during mitosis. The position of the centriole determines the position of the nucleus, thus playing a crucial role in the spatial arrangement of the cell.

Centrioles are a very important part of centrosomes, which are involved in organizing microtubules in the cytoplasm. Centrosomes are associated with the nuclear membrane during prophase of the mitosis. In mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of the centrosome arranges microtubules such that they interact with the chromosomes to build the mitotic spindle.



Figure 4.27

Here the centrosome is shown as a pair of orange cylindrical centrioles. They are made of nine triplets of microtubules.





Junctions


Junctions are areas between cells that either allow or prevent the movement of materials. Junctions are usually composed of numerous proteins, forming a large molecular complex. Gap junctions, desmosomes and tight junctions are three examples of junctions.





Gap Junctions


A gap junction or nexus is a specialized intercellular connection between a variety of animal cell-types. This junction is a type of "opening," or channel, directly connecting the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules and ions to pass freely between these cells. One gap junction channel is composed of two connexons which connect across the intercellular space. Six connexins proteins create one connexon (hemichannel) channel. Each connexin protein has four transmembrane domains. The complete gap junction is a macromolecular complex composed of several to hundreds of individual junctions. Gap junctions are especially important in cardiac muscle cells. The action potential signaling contraction is passed efficiently and effortlessly through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem. Electrical synapses in the brain also pass through gap junctions. This allows action potentials at the synaptic terminals to be transmitted across to the postsynaptic cell without the need of a neurotransmitter.

Gap junctions are analogous to the plasmodesmata that join plant cells.





Desmosomes


A desmosome is a cell junction specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion. They are found in simple and stratified squamous epithelium, and in muscle tissue where they bind muscle cells to one another. These junctions are composed of complexes of cell surface adhesion proteins and linking proteins. These proteins have both an intracellular and extracellular region. Inside the cell, they attach to intracellular filaments of the cytoskeleton. Outside the cell, they attach to other adhesion proteins.

The cell adhesion proteins of the desmosome, desmoglein and desmocollin, are members of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins. These proteins are transmembrane proteins that bridge the space between adjacent epithelial cells. The extracellular domains of these cells bind to other cadherin proteins on an adjacent cell. The extracellular domain of the desmosome is called the Extracellular Core Domain (ECD). This is where the two adhesion proteins interact.





Tight Junction


Tight junctions are the closely associated areas of two cells. It is a type of junctional complex present only in vertebrates. The corresponding junctions that occur in invertebrates are septate junctions. An example of a tight junction is between epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct part of the nephron in the kidney.

Tight junctions are common at epithelia, which are sheets of cells that form a boundary between a mass of cells and a cavity or space (a lumen ). The membranes of these cells join together, forming a virtually impermeable barrier to fluid. Tight junctions essentially seal adjacent epithelial cells in a narrow layer just beneath their apical surface, which is the portion of the cell exposed to the lumen. The rest of the cell surface is known as the basolateral surface. Tight junctions prevent integral membrane proteins from moving between the apical and basolateral surface, maintaining the properties of those distinct surfaces. For example, receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs at the apical surface and exocytosis at the basolateral surface.

Tight junctions are composed of strands of transmembrane proteins embedded in the plasma membranes of two adjacent cells. The extracellular domains of these proteins directly join to one another. These joining proteins associate with peripheral membrane proteins located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane. These peripheral proteins anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton, effectively forming a molecular complex that joins together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. The major types anchoring proteins of tight junctions are the claudins and the occludins.

In addition to holding cells together, tight junctions play a role in the transport of materials. Tight junctions prevent the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells. So these molecules and ions must actually enter cells (either by diffusion or active transport) in order to proceed through a tissue. This allows tight junctions to indirectly play a role over what substances are allowed into a specific cell. Tight junctions play this role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier.





Vocabulary

desmosome : A junctional complex cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion.

Plant Cells - Advanced


Identify and describe three structures that are present solely in plant cells.





What do plants have to do that animals don't?

When an animal needs energy, it eats food. That's why animals use mitochondria to convert food into energy. Plants, on the other hand, don't seem to eat anything. Instead, they receive energy from water and sunlight. They use chloroplasts to convert light into energy through photosynthesis. The focus of this concept is to delineate the distinct differences between plant and animal cells.





Special Structures in Plant Cells


Most of the organelles that have been discussed in other concepts, such as ribosomes, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, are common to both animal and plant cells. However, plant cells also have features that animal cells do not have; they have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts. They also have junctions called plasmodesmata.

Plants have very different lifestyles from animals, and these differences are apparent when you examine the structure of the plant cell. Plants have to make their own food, and they do so in a process called photosynthesis . They take in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O) and convert them into sugars. The features unique to plant cells can be seen in Figure below .



Figure 4.28

In addition to containing most of the organelles found in animal cells, plant cells also have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids. These three features are not found in animal cells.





Cell Wall


A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. In fact, two other classes of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectic polysaccharides, can comprise 30% of the dry mass of the cell wall. The cell wall provides structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.

Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall. Cellulose is laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall. Some plants also have a secondary cell wall. The secondary wall contains a lignin, a secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell growth/expansion.





Central Vacuole


Most mature plant cells have a central vacuole that occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume, but can also occupy as much as 90% of the volume of certain cells. The central vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast . The central vacuole has many functions. Aside from storage, the main role of the vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the tonoplast control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole. The central vacuole also stores the pigments that color flowers.

The central vacuole contains large amounts of a liquid called cell sap, which differs in composition to the cell cytosol. Cell sap is a mixture of water, enzymes, ions, salts, and other substances. Cell sap may also contain toxic byproducts that have been removed from the cytosol. Toxins in the vacuole may help to protect some plants from being eaten.





Plastids


Plant plastids are a group of closely related membrane-bound organelles that carry out many functions. They are responsible for photosynthesis, for storage of products such as starch, and for the synthesis of many types of molecules that are needed as cellular building blocks. Plastids have the ability to change their function between these and other forms. Plastids contain their own DNA and some ribosomes, and scientists think that plastids are descended from photosynthetic bacteria that allowed the first eukaryotes to make oxygen. The main types of plastids and their functions are:

Chloroplasts are the organelle of photosynthesis. They capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to make food (sugar) for the plant. The arrangement of chloroplasts in a plant’s cells can be seen in Figure below .

Chromoplasts make and store pigments that give petals and fruit their orange and yellow colors.

Leucoplasts do not contain pigments and are located in roots and non-photosynthetic tissues of plants. They may become specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid, or protein. However, in many cells, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function; instead they make molecules such as fatty acids and many amino acids.





Figure 4.29

Plant cells with visible chloroplasts.





The Chloroplast


Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food. Chloroplasts look like flat discs that are usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. A model of a chloroplast is shown in Figure below . The chloroplast is enclosed by an inner and an outer phospholipid membrane. Between these two layers is the intermembrane space. The fluid within the chloroplast is called the stroma , and it contains one or more molecules of small circular DNA. The stroma also has ribosomes. Within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids , the sub-organelles which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular: granum ). A thylakoid has a flattened disk shape. Inside it is an empty area called the thylakoid space or lumen. Photosynthesis takes place on the thylakoid membrane.

Within the thylakoid membrane is the complex of proteins and light-absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. This complex allows capture of light energy from many wavelengths because chlorophyll and carotenoids both absorb different wavelengths of light. More about how chloroplasts convert light energy into chemical energy will be presented in the Photosynthesis (Advanced) concepts.



Figure 4.30

The internal structure of a chloroplast, with a granal stack of thylakoids circled.





Plasmodesmata


Plasmodesmata (singular, plasmodesma ) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells. These junctions enable two cells to transport materials and communication between them. Plasmodesmata are similar to gap junctions of animal cells. Like gap junctions, plasmodesmata enable direct intercellular transport of substances between cells. However, unlike other junctions, plasmodesmata do not seem to be protein based. Rather, they are made from membrane and cell wall material. Plasmodesmata move various types of molecules, including transport proteins (including transcription factors), short interfering RNA, messenger RNA and viral genomes from cell to cell. A typical plant cell may have between 1,000 and 100,000 plasmodesmata connecting it with adjacent cells.

There are two forms of plasmodesmata: primary plasmodesmata, which are formed during cell division, and secondary plasmodesmata, which can form between mature cells. As plant cells are surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall, movement of materials and communication between cells is more complicated than in animal cells. Neighboring plant cells are separated by a pair of cell walls and the space between them, forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast .

Primary plasmodesmata form during cell division. These junctions form as portions of the endoplasmic reticulum are trapped in the apoplast as new cell wall is formed between two newly divided plant cells. This eventually become the cytoplasmic connections between cells (primary plasmodesmata). Secondary plasmodesmata form as plasmodesmata are inserted into existing cell walls between non-dividing cells. This process forms a cytoplasmic sleeve, a fluid-filled space enclosed by the cell membrane. The cytoplasmic sleeve is a continuous extension of the cytosol of the two adjacent cells. Molecules and ions pass through plasmodesmata using this passage. These molecules move by diffusion without the need for additional chemical energy.

Organization of Cells - Advanced


Distinguish between a colonial organism and a multicellular organism.

Outline the relationship between cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.





Why be organized?

It can be said organization leads to efficiency. And in you, cells are organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are organized into organ systems, which form you. And it can be said that the human body is a very organized and efficient system.





Organization of Cells


Biological organization exists at all levels in organisms. It can be seen at the smallest level, in the molecules that make up such compounds as DNA and proteins, to the largest level, in an organism such as a blue whale, the largest mammal on Earth. Similarly, single celled prokaryotes and eukaryotes show order in the way their cells are arranged. Single-celled organisms such as an amoeba are free-floating and independent-living. Their single-celled "bodies" are able to carry out all the processes of life such as metabolism and respiration without help from other cells.

Some single-celled organisms such as bacteria can group together and form a colony. A colony refers to a group of individual organisms of the same species that live closely together. This is usually done to benefit the group, such as by providing a stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey. A colony can also form from organisms other than bacteria. A bacterial colony often defends from a single organism, producing a colony of genetically identical individuals.

A specific type of colony of microorganisms is a biofilm. A biofilm is a large grouping of many microorganisms that sticks to a surface and makes a protective coating over itself. Biofilms can show similarities to multicellular organisms, in the sense that a biofilm will have properties and capabilities greater than the capabilities of the individual organisms.

Division of labor is the process in which one group of cells does one job (such as making the "glue" that sticks the biofilm to the surface), while another group of cells does another job (such as taking in nutrients). Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes through division of labor and they have specialized cells that have specific functions. However, biofilms are not considered a multicellular organism, but this and other colonial organisms were probably the first step toward the evolution of multicellular organisms.



Figure 4.31

Colonial algae of the genus Volvox .





Colonial Organisms


A colony of single-cell organisms is known as colonial organisms . The difference between a multicellular organism and a colonial organism is that the individual organisms that form a colony or biofilm can, if separated, survive on their own, while cells from a multicellular organism (e.g., liver cells) cannot.

Colonial organisms were probably one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms. Algae of the genus Volvox are an example of the bridge between colonial organisms and multicellular organisms. Each Volvox , shown in Figure above , is a colonial organism. It is made of up to 50,000 photosynthetic flagellate algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere. Volvox live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700.

The Volvox sphere has a distinct front and back end. The colony of cells can swim in a coordinated fashion. The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony to swim towards light.





Origin of Multicellularity


The oldest known multicellular organism is a red algae Bangiomorpha pubescens , fossils of which were found in 1.2 billion year old rock. However, the first organisms were single celled. How multicellular organisms developed is the subject of much debate.

Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between many organisms of the same species. The Colonial Theory proposes that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular organism. Many examples of cooperation between organisms in nature have been observed. For example, a certain species of amoeba (a single-celled protist) groups together during times of food shortage and forms a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoebas then become slightly differentiated from each other. Volvox, shown in Figure above , is another example of a colonial organism. Most scientists accept that the Colonial theory explains how multicellular organisms evolved.

Multicellular organisms are organisms that are made up of more than one type of cell and have specialized cells that are grouped together to carry out specialized functions. Most life that you can see without a microscope is multicellular. As discussed earlier, the cells of a multicellular organism would not survive as independent cells. The body of a multicellular organism, such as a tree or a cat, exhibits organization at several levels: tissues, organs, and organ systems. Similar cells are grouped into tissues, groups of tissues make up organs, and organs with a similar function are grouped into an organ system.





Levels of Organization in Multicellular Organisms


The simplest living multicellular organisms, sponges, are made of many specialized types of cells that work together for a common goal. Such cell types include digestive cells, tubular pore cells; and epidermal cells. Though the different cell types create a large organized, multicellular structure—the visible sponge—they are not organized into true interconnected tissues. If a sponge is broken up by passing it through a sieve, the sponge will reform on the other side. However, if the sponge’s cells are separated from each other, the individual cell types cannot survive alone. Simpler colonial organisms, such as members of the genus Volvox, as shown in Figure above , differ in that their individual cells are free-living and can survive on their own if separated from the colony.



Figure 4.32

This roundworm, a multicellular organism, was stained to highlight the nuclei of all the cells in its body (red dots).



A tissue is a group of connected cells that have a similar function within an organism. More complex organisms such as jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones have a tissue level of organization. For example, jellyfish have tissues that have separate protective, digestive, and sensory functions. Though most animals have many different types of cells, they only have four basic types of tissue: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial.

Even more complex organisms, such as the roundworm shown in Figure above , while also having differentiated cells and tissues, have an organ level of development. An organ is a group of tissues that has a specific function or group of functions. Organs can be as primitive as the brain of a flatworm (a group of nerve cells), as large as the stem of a sequoia (up to 90 meters, or 300 feet, in height), or as complex as a human liver.

The most complex organisms (such as mammals, trees, and flowers) have organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that act together to carry out complex related functions, with each organ focusing on a part of the task. An example is the human digestive system in which the mouth ingests food, the stomach crushes and liquifies it, the pancreas and gall bladder make and release digestive enzymes, and the intestines absorb nutrients into the blood.





Vocabulary


biofilm : A colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface, such as a rock or a host’s tissue.



colonial organism : Organism formed from a grouping of individuals of the same species living symbiotically together; one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms.



Colonial Theory : Proposes that cooperation between many organisms of the same species led to the development of a multicellular organism.



colony : A group of individual organisms of the same species that live closely together.



multicellular organism : Organism made up of more than one type of cell; most have specialized cells that are grouped together to carry out specialized functions.



organ : A structure composed of two or more tissues that work together for a common purpose.



organ system : A group of organs that act together to carry out complex interrelated functions, with each organ focusing on a subset of the overall task.



tissue : An aggregation of similar cells that work together to carry out a specific function within the organism/body.





Summary


Single-celled organisms are able to carry out all the processes of life without help from other cells.

Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes through division of labor. They have specialized cells that do specific jobs.

The Colonial Theory proposes that cooperation among cells of the same species led to the development of a multicellular organism.

Multicellular organisms, depending on their complexity, may be organized from cells to tissues, organs, and organ systems.

Cell Transport - Advanced


Describe the importance of cell transport.





What is cell transport?

It is the movement of substances across the cell membrane either into or out of the cell. Sometimes things just move through the phospholipid bilayer. Other times, substances need the assistance of a protein, like a channel protein or some other transmembrane protein, to cross the cell membrane.





Cell Transport


Cell transport refers to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Probably the most important feature of a cell’s phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable. A membrane that is selectively permeable , or semipermeable, has control over what molecules or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in Figure below . This feature allows a cell to control the transport of materials, as dictated by the cell's function. The permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can stay alive and healthy.



Figure 4.33

A selectively permeable, or semipermeable, membrane allows certain molecules through, but not others.





Transport Across Membranes


The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the types of molecules that can pass through it. For example, hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ), can easily pass through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as calcium (Ca 2+ ) and polar molecules such as water (H 2 O) cannot. The hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer does not allow ions or polar molecules through because they are hydrophilic, or water loving. In addition, large molecules such as sugars and proteins are too big to pass through the phospholipid bilayer. Transport proteins within the membrane allow these molecules to cross the membrane into or out of the cell. This way, polar molecules avoid contact with the nonpolar interior of the membrane, and large molecules are moved through large pores.

Every cell is contained within a membrane punctuated with transport proteins that act as channels or pumps to let in or force out certain molecules. The purpose of the transport proteins is to protect the cell's internal environment and to keep its balance of salts, nutrients, and proteins within a range that keeps the cell and the organism alive.

There are four main ways that molecules can pass through a phospholipid membrane. The first way requires no energy input by the cell and is called simple diffusion. This type of transport includes passive diffusion and osmosis. No assistance by a transport is necessary in simple diffusion. Facilitated diffusion, does involve the assistance of transport proteins. The third way, called active transport , requires that the cell uses energy to pull in or pump out certain molecules and ions. Active transport involves proteins known as pumps. The fourth way is through vesicle transport , in which large molecules are moved across the membrane in bubble-like sacks that are made from pieces of the membrane. Vesicular transport includes exocytosis and endocytosis.





Homeostasis and Cell Transport


Homeostasis refers to the balance, or equilibrium, within the cell or a body. It is an organism’s ability to keep a constant internal environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is referred to as homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the normal proportions of all internal substances. This involves continual adjustments in transport of substances across the cell membrane. Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes discussed in the cell transport (passive and active transport) concepts all play an important role in homeostatic regulation.





Vocabulary


concentration gradient : Difference in the concentrations of a molecule across two distinct areas, such as a cell membrane.



diffusion : The movement of molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration.



endocytosis : The cellular process of capturing a material/substance from outside the cell by vesicle formation.



exocytosis : The cellular process of secreting materials by vesicle fusion.



homeostasis : The process of maintaining a stable environment inside a cell or an entire organism.



passive transport : Transport of small molecules or ions across the cell membrane without an input of energy by the cell.



selectively permeable : The ability to allow only certain molecules to cross the plasma membrane; semipermeable.



semipermeable : The feature of a cell membrane that allows only select molecules (ions and organic molecules) to enter and/or leave the cell; the ability to allow only certain molecules to cross the plasma membrane; selectively permeable.





Summary


The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only certain substances to pass through.

Cell transport may require assistance by a protein/pump.

Cell transport may require energy.

Diffusion


Passive transport is a way that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell. The three main kinds of passive transport are diffusion (or simple diffusion), osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion and osmosis do not involve transport proteins. Facilitated diffusion requires the assistance of proteins.

Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration. For cell transport, diffusion is the movement of small molecules across the cell membrane. The difference in the concentrations of the molecules in the two areas is called the concentration gradient . The kinetic energy of the molecules results in random motion, causing diffusion. In simple diffusion, this process proceeds without the aid of a transport protein. it is the random motion of the molecules that causes them to move from an area of high concentration to an area with a lower concentration.

Diffusion will continue until the concentration gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to the lower, it is described as moving solutes "down the concentration gradient." The end result of diffusion is an equal concentration, or equilibrium , of molecules on both sides of the membrane. At equilibrium, movement of molecules does not stop. At equilibrium, there is equal movement of materials in both directions.

If a molecule can pass freely through a cell membrane, it will cross the membrane by diffusion ( Figure below ). The inside of the plasma membrane is hydrophobic, so certain molecules cannot easily pass through the membrane. Recall the semipermeable nature of the lipid bilayer. Molecules that cannot easily pass through the bilayer include ions and small hydrophilic molecules, such as glucose, and macromolecules, including proteins and RNA. Examples of molecules that can easily diffuse across the plasma membrane include carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. These molecules diffuse freely in and out of the cell, along their concentration gradient. Though water is a polar molecule, it can also diffuse through the plasma membrane. The diffusion of water through the cell membrane is of such importance to the cell that it is given a special name, osmosis .



Figure 4.34

Molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration until an equilibrium is met. The molecules continue to cross the membrane at equilibrium, but at equal rates in both directions.

Saltwater Fish vs. Freshwater Fish?

Fish cells, like all cells, have semi-permeable membranes. Eventually, the concentration of "stuff" on either side of them will even out. A fish that lives in salt water will have somewhat salty water inside itself. Put it in the freshwater, and the freshwater will, through osmosis, enter the fish, causing its cells to swell, and the fish will die. What will happen to a freshwater fish in the ocean?





Osmosis


Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table sugar (sucrose, C 12 H 22 O 11 ) to the water. The sugar dissolves and the mixture that is now in the cup is made up of a solute (the sugar), that is dissolved in the solvent (the water). The mixture of a solute in a solvent is called a solution .

Imagine now that you have a second cup with 100ml of water, and you add 45 grams of sucrose to the water. Just like the first cup, the sugar is the solute, and the water is the solvent. But now you have two mixtures of different solute concentrations. In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute concentration is hypertonic , and the solution with the lower concentration is hypotonic . Solutions of equal solute concentration are isotonic . The first sugar solution is hypotonic to the second solution. The second sugar solution is hypertonic to the first.

You now add the two solutions to a beaker that has been divided by a selectively permeable membrane. The pores in the membrane are too small for the sugar molecules to pass through, but are big enough for the water molecules to pass through. The hypertonic solution is on one side of the membrane and the hypotonic solution on the other. The hypertonic solution has a lower water concentration than the hypotonic solution, so a concentration gradient of water now exists across the membrane. Water molecules will move from the side of higher water concentration to the side of lower concentration until both solutions are isotonic.



What if the two solutions being compared are on either side of a cell membrane? A hypertonic solution is one having a larger concentration of a substance on the outside of a cell than is found within the cells themselves. A hypotonic solution contains a lesser concentration of impermeable solutes outside the cell compared to within the cell.

Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Water moves into and out of cells by osmosis. If a cell is in a hypertonic solution, the solution has a lower water concentration than the cell cytosol does, and water moves out of the cell until both solutions are isotonic. Cells placed in a hypotonic solution will take in water across their membrane until both the external solution and the cytosol are isotonic.

A cell that does not have a rigid cell wall (such as a red blood cell), will swell and lyse (burst) when placed in a hypotonic solution. Cells with a cell wall will swell when placed in a hypotonic solution, but once the cell is turgid (firm), the tough cell wall prevents any more water from entering the cell. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a cell without a cell wall will lose water to the environment, shrivel, and probably die. In a hypertonic solution, a cell with a cell wall will lose water too. The plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall as it shrivels, a process called plasmolysis. Animal cells tend to do best in an isotonic environment, plant cells tend to do best in a hypotonic environment. This is demonstrated in Figure below .



Figure 4.35

Unless an animal cell (such as the red blood cell in the top panel) has an adaptation that allows it to alter the osmotic uptake of water, it will lose too much water and shrivel up in a hypertonic environment. If placed in a hypotonic solution, water molecules will enter the cell causing it to swell and burst. Plant cells (bottom panel) become plasmolyzed in a hypertonic solution, but tend to do best in a hypotonic environment. Water is stored in the central vacuole of the plant cell.





Osmotic Pressure


When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure may build up inside the cell. If a cell has a cell wall, the wall helps maintain the cell’s water balance. Osmotic pressure is the main cause of support in many plants. When a plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the cell. At this point the plant cell is turgid ( Figure below ). The effects of osmotic pressures on plant cells are shown in Figure above .



Figure 4.36

The central vacuoles of the plant cells in this image are full of water, so the cells are turgid.



Osmosis can be seen very effectively when potato slices are added to a high concentration of salt solution (hypertonic). The water from inside the potato moves out of the potato cells to the salt solution, which causes the potato cells to lose turgor pressure. The more concentrated the salt solution, the greater the difference in the size and weight of the potato slice after plasmolysis.

The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms, especially ones without cell walls. For example, if a saltwater fish (whose cells are isotonic with seawater), is placed in fresh water, its cells will take on excess water, lyse, and the fish will die. Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill slugs and snails.

Controlling Osmosis


Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis. A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore. Other protists, such as members of the genus Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles that move to the surface of the cell when full and release the water into the environment.



Figure 4.37

The contractile vacuole is the star-like structure within the paramecia.

Summary


Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane and down a concentration gradient. They can move into or out of a cell, depending on the concentration of the solute.

Can you help me move?

What is one of the questions no one likes to be asked? Sometimes the cell needs help moving things as well, or facilitating the diffusion process. And this would be the job of a special type of protein.





Facilitated Diffusion


Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through integral membrane transport proteins. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport . Even though facilitated diffusion involves transport proteins (and is essentially a transport process), it can still be considered passive transport because the solute is moving down the concentration gradient, and no input of energy is required. Facilitated diffusion utilizes proteins known as uniporters. A uniporter can be either a channel protein or a carrier protein.

As was mentioned earlier, small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane. However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the phospholipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules and ions cannot do so. Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A transport protein completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.

A channel protein , a type of transport protein, acts like a pore in the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly. Water channel proteins allow water to diffuse across the membrane at a very fast rate. Ion channel proteins allow ions to diffuse across the membrane.

A gated channel protein is a transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to pass through the membrane. Gated channels have a binding site that is specific for a given molecule or ion. A stimulus causes the "gate" to open or shut. The stimulus may be chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force, depending on the type of gated channel. For example, the sodium gated channels of a nerve cell are stimulated by a chemical signal which causes them to open and allow sodium ions into the cell. Glucose molecules are too big to diffuse through the plasma membrane easily, so they are moved across the membrane through gated channels. In this way glucose diffuses very quickly across a cell membrane, which is important because many cells depend on glucose for energy.

A carrier protein is a transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or group of substances. Carrier proteins "carry" the ion or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of the ion or molecule. Carrier proteins are involved in passive and active transport. A model of a channel protein and carrier proteins is shown in Figure below .



Figure 4.38

Facilitated diffusion through the cell membrane. Channel proteins and carrier proteins are shown (but not a gated-channel protein). Water molecules and ions move through channel proteins. Other ions or molecules are also carried across the cell membrane by carrier proteins. The ion or molecule binds to the active site of a carrier protein. The carrier protein changes shape, and releases the ion or molecule on the other side of the membrane. The carrier protein then returns to its original shape.

Ion Channels


Ions such as sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), and chloride (Cl - ), are important for many cell functions. Because they are polar, these ions do not diffuse through the membrane. Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Ion channels allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Ion channels are very specific as they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane. Some ion channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened or closed. Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different types of stimuli such as electrical or chemical signals.





Vocabulary


carrier protein : A transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or group of substances; carries the ion or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of the ion or molecule.



channel protein : A transport protein that acts like a pore in the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly.



facilitated diffusion : The diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane.



gated channel protein : A transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to flow through the membrane.



ion channel : A channel protein that transports ions across the membrane by facilitated diffusion.



passive transport : Transport of small molecules or ions across the cell membrane without an input of energy by the cell.



transport protein : A protein that completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane; channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.



uniporter : An integral membrane protein that is involved in facilitated diffusion; can be either a channel or a carrier protein.





Summary


Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.

Active Transport - Advanced


Compare passive and active transport.

Explain how different types of active transport occur.





Need to move something really heavy?

If you did, it would take a lot of energy. Sometimes, moving things into or out of the cell also takes energy. How would the cell move something against a concentration gradient? It starts by using energy.





Active Transport


In contrast to facilitated diffusion which does not require energy and carries molecules or ions down a concentration gradient, active transport pumps molecules and ions against a concentration gradient. Sometimes an organism needs to transport something against a concentration gradient, such as specific ions, or glucose and amino acids. The only way this can be done is through active transport which uses transport proteins and energy that is produced by cellular respiration (ATP) or through an electrochemical gradient . In active transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. Active transport is the energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes "uphill" against a gradient. The active transport of small molecules or ions across a cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins that are found in the membrane. These transport proteins have receptor regions that bind to specific molecules and transport them into the cell. Larger molecules such as starch can also be actively transported across the cell membrane by vesicular transport processes.

During active transport, specialized integral membrane proteins recognize the substance and allows it access. Essentially this process is forcing a ion or molecule to cross the membrane when normally it would not. Moving a substance against its concentration gradient is known as primary active transport , and the proteins involved in it as "pumps". This process uses the energy of ATP. In secondary active transport , energy from an electrochemical gradient is used to transport substances. This process involves pore-forming proteins that form channels through the cell membrane.





Primary Active Transport


Primary active transport involves an integral membrane protein and the energy from ATP to transport molecules across a membrane. This type of transport is mainly done by ATPases. ATPases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a free phosphate ion. This reaction releases energy, which is used to drive other chemical reactions that would not otherwise occur.

One ATPase necessary to all life is the sodium-potassium pump, which helps to maintain the cell potential. This pump will be discussed in the Active Transport: The Sodium-Potassium Pump (Advanced) concept. Other sources of energy for primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light energy). Redox energy is used in the mitochondrial electron transport chain during cellular respiration. In this transport, the reduction energy of NADH is used to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using photon energy occurs during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, proteins use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. That energy is used to pump H + ions into the thylakoid.





Secondary Active Transport


In secondary active transport, which is also known as cotransport , energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane. However, in contrast to primary active transport, there is no direct coupling of ATP. Instead, the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions out of the cell is used. The process is called cotransport because one carrier protein mediates the transport of both substances. The two main forms of this are antiport and symport.





Antiport and Symport


The difference between the two types of cotransport depends on the direction of transport of the molecules. A system in which one substance moves in one direction while cotransporting another substance in the other direction is called antiport . Symport is transport of two substrates in the same direction across the membrane. The protein involved in this transport is a symporter. The protein involved in antiport is an antiporter.

The energy for these processes come from an electrochemical gradient. In such a gradient, one of the two substances is transported in the direction of their concentration gradient,and the energy derived is used to transport the second substance against its concentration gradient. Thus, energy stored in the electrochemical gradient of an ion is used to drive the transport of another solute against a concentration or electrochemical gradient. In antiport, one substance moves along its electrochemical gradient, allowing a different substance to move against its own electrochemical gradient. This movement is in contrast to primary active transport, in which all solutes are moved against their concentration gradients, fueled by ATP. In symport, one substance moves down the electrochemical gradient, allowing the other molecule(s) to move against its concentration gradient. One substance moves by facilitated diffusion, which is coupled with the active transport of the other substance.





Vocabulary


active transport : Transport of molecules and ions across membranes against a concentration gradient; requires energy.



antiport : The secondary active transport process of transporting two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in opposite directions.



antiporter : An integral membrane protein involved in secondary active transport; transports two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in opposite directions.



ATPase : A class of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a free phosphate ion.



cotransport : The simultaneous or sequential transport of more than one molecule or ion across biological membranes; also known as secondary active transport.



electrochemical gradient : Difference across a membrane due to both a chemical force and an electrical force; drives the movement of ions across the membrane.



primary active transport : Active transport in which solutes are moved against their concentration gradients; fueled by ATP.



redox energy : Energy that is either stored or released by redox reactions.



secondary active transport : Active transport in which one substance moves along its electrochemical gradient, allowing a different substance to move against its own electrochemical gradient; also known as cotransport.



symport : The secondary active transport process of transporting two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in the same direction.



symporter : An integral membrane protein involved in secondary active transport; transports two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane in the same direction.





Summary


Active transport moves molecules across a cell membrane from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. Active transport requires the use of energy.

The active transport of small molecules or ions across a cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins that are found in the membrane.

During antiport and symport two substances are cotransported.

The Sodium-Potassium Pump - Advanced


Explain how different types of active transport occur.

Describe the function of the sodium-potassium pump.





What is this incredible object?

Would it surprise you to learn that it is a human cell? The image represents an active human nerve cell. How nerve cells function will be the focus of another concept. However, active transport processes play a significant role in the function of these cells. Specifically, it is the sodium-potassium pump that is active in the axons of these nerve cells.





The Sodium-Potassium Pump


Carrier proteins can work with a concentration gradient (passive transport), but some carrier proteins can move solutes against the concentration gradient (from low concentration to high concentration), with energy input from ATP. As in other types of cellular activities, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP powers active transport is by transferring a phosphate group directly to a carrier protein. This may cause the carrier protein to change its conformation, which moves the molecule or ion to the other side of the membrane. An example of this type of active transport system, as shown in Figure below , is the sodium-potassium pump, or Na + /K + -ATPase , a transmembrane ATPase, an integral membrane protein that exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions across the plasma membrane of animal cells. The sodium-potassium pump is found in the plasma membrane of almost every human cell and is common to all cellular life. It helps maintain resting potential , especially in neurons following a nerve impulse, and regulates cellular volume.



Figure 4.39

The sodium-potassium pump system moves sodium and potassium ions against large concentration gradients. It moves two potassium ions into the cell where potassium levels are high, and pumps three sodium ions out of the cell and into the extracellular fluid.





The Mechanism


As is shown in Figure above , the sodium-potassium pump transports Na + ions and K + ions in the following manner:

The sodium-potassium pump binds ATP and three intracellular Na + ions.

ATP is hydrolyzed resulting in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate. The free phosphate phosphorylates the sodium-potassium pump.

A conformational change in the pump exposes the Na + ions to the outside. The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for Na + ions, so they are released.

The pump binds two extracellular K + ions. This causes the dephosphorylation of the pump, reverting it to its previous conformational state, transporting the K + ions into the cell.

The unphosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for Na + ions than K + ions, so the two bound K + ions are released.

ATP binds, and the process starts again.

The Electrochemical Gradient - Advanced


Describe the electrochemical gradient.





Do you really have electricity flowing through your body?

Yes you do. These electrical signals allow information to flow through the nervous system extremely rapidly. And it all starts with the formation of an electrochemical gradient.





The Electrochemical Gradient


The active transport of ions across the cell membrane causes an electrical gradient to build up across this membrane. The number of positively charged ions outside the cell is usually greater than the number of positively charged ions in the cytosol. This results in a relatively negative charge on the inside of the membrane, and a positive charge on the outside. This difference in charges causes a voltage to exist across the membrane. Voltage is electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of opposite charges, in this case across the membrane. The voltage across a membrane is the membrane potential . Membrane potential is very important for the conduction of electrical impulses along nerve cells. The membrane potential of a cell at rest is known as its resting potential , and is discussed below. A non-excited nerve cell is an example of a cell at rest.

Because of the ion gradient, there are less positive ions inside the cell, the inside of the cell is negative compared to outside the cell. This resulting membrane potential favors the movement of positively charged ions (cations) into the cell, and the movement of negative ions (anions) out of the cell. So, there are two forces that drive the diffusion of ions across the plasma membrane—a chemical force (the ions' concentration gradient), and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ions’ movement). These two forces working together are called an electrochemical gradient .

The electrochemical gradient determines the direction an ion moves by diffusion or active transport across a membrane. In mitochondria and chloroplasts, proton gradients are used to generate a chemiosmotic potential that is also known as a proton motive force , due to both the proton gradient and voltage gradient across the membrane. This potential energy is used for the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation .





The Resting Potential


In order to maintain the membrane potential, cells maintain a low concentration of sodium ions (Na + ) and high levels of potassium ions (K + ) within the cell (intracellular). The sodium-potassium pump moves three Na + ions out of the cell and brings two K + ions into the cell. This essentially removes one positive charge from the intracellular space. The resulting membrane potential is known as the resting potential.



Figure 4.40

This diagram shows how ions maintain the membrane potential. The sodium-potassium pump is shown in the membrane, transporting three Na + ions (green) out of the cell and bringing two K + ions (blue) into the cell.





The Ion Gradient


The electrochemical potential across a membrane determines the tendency of an ion to cross the membrane. The membrane may be that of a cell or organelle or other sub cellular compartment. The electrochemical potential arises from three factors:

the difference in the concentration of the ions on either side of the membrane,

the charge of the ions (for example Na + , Ca ++ , Cl - ), and

the difference in voltage between the two sides of the membrane (the transmembrane potential).



Cotransport of ions by symporters and antiporter carriers is commonly used to actively move ions across biological membranes. Transmembrane ATPases are often involved in maintaining ion gradients. The Na+/K+ ATPase uses ATP to build and maintain a sodium ion gradient and a potassium ion gradient.





Proton Gradients and ATP synthase


One particular ion gradient with biological significance is the proton (H + ) gradient. This type of gradient is established through active transport involving proton pumps. The proton gradient is used during photosynthesis and cellular respiration to generate a chemiosmotic potential, or proton motive force. This potential energy is used for the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The proton gradient can also be used to store energy for heat production and flagellar rotation.

The energy held within the proton gradient can be used to synthesize ATP. ATP synthase is a transmembrane enzyme that provides energy for the cell to use by producing ATP. The protein has two distinct regions, F 0 and F 1 . The F 0 domain is embedded within the membrane, while the F 1 domain is above the membrane, inside the matrix of the mitochondria, or the stroma of the chloroplast. The F 0 region is the proton pore, allowing hydrogen ions to diffuse across the membrane. The F 1 region of the protein has ATP synthesis activity, catalyzing the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Hence, ATP synthase is both an ion channel protein and enzyme. The synthesis reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the rotation of a part of the enzyme; the ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor. Bacteria may also have a version of this enzyme, where it, of course, is embedded in the cell membrane.

During electron transport within the mitochondria (during cellular respiration) or chloroplast (during photosynthesis) (discussed in the Concept Metabolism (Advanced) concept), a proton gradient is formed when protons are pumped across the membrane by active transport. These hydrogen ions flow back across the membrane by facilitated diffusion through ATP synthase, releasing energy which is then used to convert ADP to ATP (by phosphorylation). Chemiosmosis is the diffusion of protons across the biological membrane through ATP synthase, due to a proton gradient that forms across the membrane during electron transport.





Vocabulary


ATP synthase : Ion channel and enzyme complex; chemically bonds a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP as H + ions flow through the ion channel.



chemiosmosis : Process in cellular respiration or photosynthesis which produces ATP; uses the energy of hydrogen ions diffusing through ATP synthase.



chemiosmotic potential : A difference in concentration of hydrogen ions across a membrane within the mitochondrion or chloroplast; established using energy from an electron transport chain; also known as a chemiosmotic gradient.



electrochemical gradient : Difference across a membrane due to both a chemical force and an electrical force; drives the movement of ions across the membrane.



membrane potential : The voltage difference across a membrane; the basis for the conduction of nerve impulses along the cell membrane of neurons.



oxidative phosphorylation : A metabolic process that uses energy released by the oxidation of nutrients to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP).



proton gradient : Gradient established from a higher concentration of protons on one side of a membrane compared to the other side of the membrane.

resting potential : The membrane potential of a cell/neuron at rest; the membrane potential of an unstimulated neuron.



voltage : The difference in electrical potential energy of two points/areas; electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of opposite charges.





Summary


The voltage across a membrane is the membrane potential and the membrane potential of a cell at rest is the resting potential.

The electrochemical gradient is composed of a chemical force (the ions' concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ions’ movement).

What does a cell "eat"?

Is it possible for objects larger than a small molecule to be engulfed by a cell? Of course it is. This image depicts a cancer cell being attacked by a cell of the immune system. Cells of the immune system consistently destroy pathogens by essentially "eating" them. Just as cells can bring substances into the cell, they can also export substances out of the cell.





Vesicles and Active Transport


Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein. So cells use two other active transport methods to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell. Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane. There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis. These processes are active transport mechanisms, therefore energy is required.





Endocytosis and Exocytosis


Endocytosis is the process of capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane. The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane. At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle pinches off and moves the substance into the cytosol. There are two main kinds of endocytosis:

Phagocytosis or "cellular eating," occurs when the dissolved materials enter the cell. The plasma membrane engulfs the solid material, forming a phagocytic vesicle.

Pinocytosis or "cellular drinking," occurs when the plasma membrane folds inward to form a channel allowing dissolved substances to enter the cell, as shown in Figure below . When the channel is closed, the liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.





Figure 4.41

Transmission electron microscope image of brain tissue that shows pinocytotic vesicles. Pinocytosis is a type of endocytosis.



Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure below . Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved to the plasma membrane by exocytosis.

Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis


Some substances are internalized after binding to a membrane-bound receptor. This process is known as receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). RME is a process by which cells internalize molecules by endocytosis. This occurs by the inward budding of plasma membrane vesicles containing proteins with receptor sites specific to the molecules being internalized. After the binding of a ligand to the plasma membrane-spanning receptors, a signal is sent through the membrane, leading to membrane coating by the protein clathrin , and formation of a membrane invagination. The receptor and its ligand are then internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles. RME is also known as clathrin-dependent endocytosis, named after the clathrin protein that accumulates on the internal segment of membrane that will form a vesicle.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is further discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZFnO5RY1cU .

Homeostasis and Cell Function


Homeostasis refers to the balance, or equilibrium within the cell or a body. It is an organism’s ability to keep a constant internal environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the normal level or range). Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes discussed in this lesson all play an important role in homeostatic regulation. More concerning homeostasis will be presented in additional concepts.

Summary


Endocytosis and exocytosis are active transport mechanisms in which large molecules enter and leave the cell inside vesicles.

In endocytosis, a substance or particle from outside the cell is engulfed by the cell membrane. The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane. There are two main kinds of endocytosis: pinocytosis and phagocytosis.

Cell Communication - Advanced


Describe what is meant by cell communication.





What does adrenaline do?

Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is a hormone and a neurotransmitter. It increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, dilates air passages, and participates in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenaline is produced in the adrenal medulla of the adrenal gland. So how does it effect processes all over the body?





The Language of Cells


To survive and grow, cells need to be able to communicate with their neighboring cells and be able to detect change in their environment. "Talking" with neighboring cells is even more important to a cell if it is part of a multicellular organism. Cell communication, or cell signaling, is the basis of development, tissue repair, and immunity. It is also necessary for normal tissue homeostasis. The trillions of cells that make up your body need to be able to communicate with each other to allow your body to grow, and to keep you alive and healthy. The same is true for any organism. Cell signaling is part of a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions. Cell signaling is a major area of research in biology today. Defects in cell signaling are associated with diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.

Recently scientists have discovered that many different cell types, from bacteria to plants, use similar types of communication pathways, or cell-signaling mechanisms. This suggests that cell-signaling mechanisms evolved long before the first multicellular organism did.

For cells to be able to signal to each other, a few things are needed:

a signal,

a cell receptor , which is a protein usually on the plasma membrane, but can be found inside the cell,

a response to the signal.



Cells that are communicating may be right next to each other or far apart. In juxtacrine signaling , also known as contact-dependent signaling, two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. Cell communication may also occur over short distances, which is known as paracrine signaling , or over large distances, which is known as endocrine signaling .

The type of chemical signal a cell will send differs depending on the distance the message needs to go. For example, hormones , ions, and neurotransmitters are all types of signals that are sent depending on the distance the message needs to go. Endocrine signals are hormones, produced by endocrine organs. These signals travel through the blood stream to reach all parts of the body.

The target cell then needs to be able to recognize the signal. Chemical signals are received by the target cell on receptor proteins. Most receptor proteins are found associated with the plasma membrane, but some are also found inside the cell. Receptor proteins are very specific for only one particular signal molecule, much like a lock that recognizes only one key. Therefore, a cell has lots of receptor proteins to recognize the large number of cell signal molecules. There are three stages to sending and receiving a cell "message:" reception, transduction, and response.

Reception occurs when a ligand binds to its receptor.

Through transduction, the signal is then internalized. The ligand does not have to be internalized for this process to occur.

The response may initiate a cascade of reactions including the activation/deactivation of enzymes and/or an alternation in gene transcription.





Vocabulary


cell receptor : Specialized proteins that take part in communication between the cell and the extracellular environment; often are integral membrane proteins.



cell signaling : Part of a complex communication system that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions.

Cell communication or cell signaling describes how cells share information.

Cell communication usually begins when a molecule (a ligand) binds to its receptor.

Cell communication can be over short or long distances.

Signal Receptors - Advanced


Describe the types of signal receptors used in cell communication.





What pulls a signal in from vast distances?

Some sort of signal receptor. This receptor is usually a protein embedded in the cell membrane. Once the signal binds to its receptor, some sort of outcome is initiated - the signal is transferred to the cell. This may be from an ion channel opening or some other process.





Signal Receptors


A signal molecule must bind to its receptor to initiate a response. Receptors are proteins that bind to their signal molecule either externally (cell-surface receptors) or internally (nuclear receptors) within the cytoplasm or nucleus. This process is known as signal transduction , and the internal activator is the second messenger . Once a ligand binds to its receptor, a series of reactions are initiated.





Cell-Surface Receptors


Cell-surface receptors are integral membrane proteins—they reach right through the phospholipid bilayer, spanning from the outside to the inside of the cell. These receptor proteins are specific for just one signal molecule. The signaling molecule acts as a ligand when it binds to a receptor protein. A ligand is a small molecule that binds to a larger molecule. Signal molecule binding causes the receptor protein to undergo a conformational change (a change in shape). At this point the receptor protein can interact with another molecule. The ligand (the signal molecule) itself does not pass through the plasma membrane.

In eukaryotic cells, most of the intracellular proteins that are activated by a ligand binding to a receptor protein are enzymes. Receptor proteins are named after the type of enzyme that they interact with inside the cell. These enzymes include G proteins and protein kinases, likewise there are G-protein-linked receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors. A kinase is a protein involved in phosphorylation. Tyrosine kinase receptors bind many polypeptide growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. Once the ligand is bound, these receptors specifically phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids, activating the signal transduction process inside the cell.

A G-protein linked receptor is a receptor that works with the help of a protein called a G-protein. A G-protein gets its name from the molecule to which it is attached, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), or guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The GTP molecule is similar to ATP.





Second Messengers


Once G proteins or protein kinase enzymes are activated by a receptor protein - after the ligand binds to its receptor - they create molecules called second messengers. A second messenger is a small molecule that starts a change inside a cell in response to the binding of a specific signal to a receptor protein. Some second messenger molecules include small molecules called cyclic nucleotides, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) also act as secondary messengers. Secondary messengers are a part of signal transduction pathways.



Figure 4.44

Two-component signal transduction system. This process begins with the stimulus binding to its receptor. Shown here is a cell-surface receptor. The signal in then transduced to the inside of the cell.





Nuclear Receptors


Some receptors bind the ligand internally. In this case, the ligand must be able to enter the cell. These receptors usually interact with steroid and thyroid hormones. Once the ligand binds to the receptor, the receptor becomes activated, and the whole complex enters the nucleus, hence these receptors are known as nuclear receptors. In the nucleus, the activated receptor acts as a transcription factor, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.





Vocabulary


cell-surface receptor : Specialized integral membrane protein that take part in communication between the cell and the extracellular environment.



cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP) : A second messenger important in many biological processes; used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones.



G protein (guanine nucleotide-binding protein) : Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins; a family of proteins involved in transmitting chemical signals outside the cell, causing changes inside the cell.



G-protein linked receptor : A large protein family of transmembrane receptors that bind molecules outside the cell and activate signal transduction pathways inside the cell; also known as G protein coupled receptors and seven-transmembrane domain receptors.



kinase : A type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific substrates, a process known as phosphorylation.



ligand : A small molecule that binds to a larger molecule.



nuclear receptor : A class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for binding steroid and thyroid hormones; may act as a transcription factor.



second messenger : A molecule that relays a signal from a receptor on the cell surface to target molecules inside the cell.



signal transduction : The process that occurs when an extracellular signaling molecule activates a cell surface receptor, which then alters intracellular molecules creating a response.



transcription factor : A protein involved in regulating gene expression; usually bound to a cis-regulatory element on the DNA; also known as a regulatory protein or a trans-acting factor.



tyrosine kinase receptor : Family of cell surface receptors for many polypeptide growth factors, cytokines, and hormones; specifically phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids; also known as receptor tyrosine kinases.





Summary


Signal transduction begins with a ligand binding to its receptor.

Cell-surface receptors bind a ligand outside of the cell and internalize the signal, acting through a second messenger.

Nuclear receptors bind a ligand inside the cell and change transcription of genes by acting as a transcription factor.

Signal Transduction - Advanced


Outline the process of signal transduction.





How is information transduced from the outside of the cell?

It starts with the ligand binding its receptor. Once the signal is internalized, the second messenger then begins a cascade of reactions that can greatly change the behavior of the cell.





Signal Transduction


A signal-transduction pathway is the signaling mechanism by which a cell changes a signal on its surface into a specific response inside the cell. This process begins when a ligand binds to its receptor. The receptor may either be a cell-surface receptor in the cell membrane or a nuclear receptor in the cytoplasm of the cell. See DNA responds to signals from outside the cell at http://www.dnaftb.org/35/animation.html to see James Darnall speak about signal transduction.

Signal transduction most often involves an ordered sequence of chemical reactions inside the cell which is carried out by enzymes and other molecules. In many signal transduction processes, the number of proteins and other molecules participating in these events increases as the process progresses from the binding of the signal. A "signal cascade" begins. Think of a signal cascade as a chemical domino-effect inside the cell, in which one domino knocks over two dominoes, which in turn knock over four dominoes, and so on. The advantage of this type of signaling to the cell is that the message from one little signal molecule can be greatly amplified and have a dramatic effect.



Figure 4.45

How a G-protein linked receptor works with the help of a G-protein.





G Proteins


G proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) are a family of GTPases involved in transmitting chemical signals outside the cell, and causing changes inside the cell. When a ligand binds to a G protein coupled receptor, an intracellular domain of the receptor activates a G protein. The G protein then activates additional intracellular pathways, resulting in an altered intracellular environment. G proteins function as molecular switches. When they bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP), they are 'on', and, when they bind guanosine diphosphate (GDP), they are 'off'.





G Protein Coupled Receptors and Cyclic AMP


G protein linked receptors are only found in higher eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, and animals. Your senses of sight and smell are dependent on G-protein linked receptors. The ligands that bind to these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The ligands for G-protein linked receptors come in different sizes, from small molecules to large proteins. When a ligand binds to the receptor, it causes a conformational change in the receptor, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The receptor can then activate an associated G-protein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G-protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins.

Many times the activated G-protein-linked receptor will then activate cyclic AMP (cAMP) , which acts as the second messenger in initiating a cascade of reactions.

The process of how a G-protein linked receptor works is outlined in Figure below .



Figure 4.46

How a G-protein linked receptor works with the help of a G-protein. In panel C, the second messenger cAMP can be seen moving away from the enzyme.



G-Protein Linked Receptors

A ligand such as a hormone (small, purple molecule) binds to the G protein-linked receptor (red molecule). Before ligand binding, the inactive G-protein (yellow molecule) has GDP bound to it.

The receptor changes shape and activates the G-protein and a molecule of GTP replaces the GDP.

The G-protein moves across the membrane then binds to and activates the enzyme (green molecule). This then triggers the next step in the pathway to the cell's response. After activating the enzyme, the G-protein returns to its original position. The second messenger of this signal transduction is cAMP, as shown in C.





The sensing of the external and internal environments at the cellular level relies on signal transduction. Defects in signal transduction pathways can contribute or lead to many diseases, including cancer and heart disease. This highlights the importance of signal transductions to biology and medicine.

G-protein linked receptors are also involved in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signal pathway. In this pathway, PI can be phosphorylated to form phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP 3 ), which are collectively called phosphoinositides. These molecules play important roles in lipid signaling, cell signaling and membrane trafficking.





Signal Response


In response to a signal, a cell may change activities in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus that include the switching on or off of genes. Changes in metabolism, continued growth, movement, or death are some of the cellular responses to signals that require signal transduction.

Gene activation leads to other effects, since the protein products of many of the responding genes include enzymes and factors that increase gene expression. Gene expression factors produced as a result of a cascade can turn on even more genes. Therefore one stimulus can trigger the expression of many genes, and this in turn can lead to the activation of many complex events. In a multicellular organism these events include the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream (stimulated by insulin), and the movement of neutrophils to sites of infection (stimulated by bacterial products). The set of genes and the order in which they are activated in response to stimuli are often called a genetic program.



Figure 4.47

Signal transduction pathways. Ras (upper middle section) activates a number of pathways but an especially important one seems to be the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). MAPK transmit signals downstream to other protein kinases and gene regulatory proteins. Note that many of these pathways are initiated when a signal binds to its receptor outside the cell. Most pathways end with altered gene regulation and cell proliferation. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is shown at the lower section of the figure stimulating p21. The complexity of the pathways demonstrate the significant role these play in the cell.

Often the signal is transducer from the outside of the cell to the inside.

This process usually involves G-protein linked receptors and cyclic AMP.

Summary


The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not. Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism. The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, defines the life of an eukaryotic cell.

Biochemistry - Advanced


Introduction




What do you get when you cross biology and chemistry?

Hummingbirds, with their tiny bodies and high levels of activity, have the highest metabolic rates of any animals — roughly a dozen times that of a pigeon and a hundred times that of an elephant. The metabolic rate, or rate of metabolism, has to do with the amount of energy the organism uses. And that energy is used to drive the chemical reactions in cells — or the biochemical reactions. And, of course, it is all the biochemical reactions that allow the cells function properly, and maintain life.





Biochemical Energy - Advanced


Define energy, and describe how energy can be changed from one form to another.





What is energy? Where does your energy come from? Can energy be recycled?

This team of ants is breaking down a dead tree. A classic example of teamwork. And all that work takes energy. In fact, each chemical reaction - the chemical reactions that allow the cells in those ants to do the work - needs energy to get started. And all that energy comes from the food the ants eat. Whatever eats the ants gets their energy from the ants. Energy passes through an ecosystem in one direction only.





Matter and Energy


All living things are made of matter . In fact, matter is the “stuff” of which all organisms are made. Anything that occupies space and has mass is known as matter. Matter, in turn, consists of chemical substances. It is the carbons, hydrogens, oxygens and other elements that combine to form molecules, compounds, organelles, cells and eventually tissues, organs and organisms. In addition to being made of matter, all living organisms also need energy to survive.

Energy is a property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work. The concept of energy is useful for explaining and predicting most natural phenomena, and it is the foundation for an understanding of biology. All living organisms need energy to grow and reproduce. However, energy can never be created nor destroyed. Energy can only be transformed. That is, energy is always conserved. This is called the law of conservation of energy . Therefore, organisms cannot create the energy they need. Instead, they must obtain energy from the environment. Organisms also cannot destroy or use up the energy they obtain. They can only change it from one form to another. Organisms will either use their energy (for metabolism) or release it to the environment as heat.

In biology, energy is required for ecosystems to survive, as all living organisms need energy. Within an organism, energy is needed for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle within that cell. Energy is also needed for all biochemical reactions within that cell. Therefore, energy is stored within cells in the chemical bonds of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins. This energy is released during aerobic respiration.

The energy for most living organisms initially originates from the sun. This energy is absorbed by producers, usually photosynthetic organisms such as plants. Plants convert this energy into chemical energy, in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. Energy can be stored in this state, or converted into a usable form of energy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) . This occurs in both the plant, as well as the organisms that eat the plant, or eat the organism that ate the plant.





Forms of Energy


Energy can take several different forms. Common forms of energy include light, chemical, and heat energy. Other common forms are kinetic and potential energy.





How Organisms Change Energy


In organisms, energy is always changing from one form to another. For example, plants obtain light energy from sunlight and change it to chemical energy in food molecules, such as glucose. Chemical energy is energy stored in bonds between atoms within food molecules. When other organisms eat and digest the food, they break the chemical bonds and release the chemical energy. Organisms do not use energy very efficiently. About 90 percent of the energy they obtain from food is converted to heat energy that is given off to the environment.





Kinetic and Potential Energy


Energy also constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of movement. For example, a ball falling through the air has kinetic energy because it is moving ( Figure below ). The random motion of molecules is due to kinetic energy, and the driving force behind diffusion.

Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position. A bouncing ball at the top of a bounce, just before it starts to fall, has potential energy. For that instant, the ball is not moving, but it has the potential to move because gravity is pulling on it. Once the ball starts to fall, the potential energy changes to kinetic energy. When the ball hits the ground, it gains potential energy from the impact. The potential energy changes to kinetic energy when the ball bounces back up into the air. As the ball gains height, it regains potential energy because of gravity.



Figure 5.1

Energy in a bouncing ball is transformed from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy. This cycle of energy changes keeps repeating as long as the ball continues to bounce. The ball rises less on each successive bounce because some energy is used to resist air molecules.



Like the ball, every time you move you have kinetic energy — whether you jump or run or just blink your eyes. Can you think of situations in which you have potential energy? Obvious examples might include when you are standing on a diving board or at the top of a ski slope or bungee jump. What gives you potential energy in all of these situations? The answer is gravity.

Summary


Energy is a property of matter. It cannot be created or destroyed. Organisms obtain light energy from sunlight or chemical energy from food and change the energy into different forms, including heat energy.

States of Matter in Biological Systems - Advanced


Identify three states of matter and explain how they differ.





Solid, liquid or gas?

The state of matter is a physical property of that matter. H 2 O can exist in three different states of matter. This glacier is obviously a solid state of H 2 O, floating in the liquid state. Why does the ice float on water? Which has a greater density, solid H 2 O or liquid H 2 O?





States of Matter


The amount of energy in molecules of matter determines the state of matter . Matter can exist in one of several different states, including a gas, liquid, or solid state. These different states of matter have different properties, which are illustrated in Figure below . Gasses have the most energy, and solids have the least energy.

A gas is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules have enough energy to move freely. The molecules come into contact with one another only when they randomly collide. Forces between atoms or molecules are not strong enough to hold them together, allowing the molecules to move independently of one another.

A liquid is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules are constantly in contact but have enough energy to keep changing positions relative to one another. Forces between atoms or molecules are strong enough to keep the molecules together but not strong enough to prevent them from moving. The particles of a liquid have enough energy to allow them to slide past one another, but not enough energy to allow them to move freely.

A solid is a state of matter in which atoms or molecules do not have enough energy to move. They are constantly in contact and in fixed positions relative to one another. Forces between atoms or molecules are strong enough to keep the molecules together and to prevent them from moving. The particles of a solid only have enough energy to vibrate in place.





Figure 5.2

States of Matter.



All three containers contain a substance with the same mass, but the substances are in different states. In the left-hand container, the substance is a gas, which has spread to fill its container. It takes both the shape and volume of the container. In the middle container, the substance is a liquid, which has spread to take the shape of its container but not the volume. In the right-hand container, the substance is a solid, which takes neither the shape nor the volume of its container.





What Determines a Substance’s State?


A substance's state depends partly on temperature and air pressure. For example, at the air pressure found at sea level, water exists as a liquid at temperatures between 0°C and 100°C. Above 100°C, water exists as a gas (water vapor). Below 0°C, water exists as a solid (ice). Different substances have a different range of temperatures at which they exist in each state. For example, oxygen is gas above -183°C, but iron is a gas only above 2861°C. These differences explain why some substances are always solids at normal Earth temperatures, whereas others are always gases or liquids.





Changing States


Matter constantly goes through cycles that involve changing states. Water and all the elements important to organisms, including carbon and nitrogen, are constantly recycled on Earth (see Principles of Ecology ). As matter moves through its cycles, it changes state repeatedly. For example, in the water cycle, water repeatedly changes from a gas to a liquid or solid and back to a gas again. How does this happen?

Adding energy to matter gives its atoms or molecules the ability to resist some of the forces holding them together. For example, heating ice to its melting point (0°C) gives its molecules enough energy to move. The ice melts and becomes liquid water. Similarly, heating liquid water to its boiling point (100°C) gives its molecules enough energy to pull apart from one another so they no longer have contact. The liquid water vaporizes and becomes water vapor.

In biological systems, matter is continuously changing states as well. For example, carbon in the form of the gas carbon dioxide is changed into glucose, a solid. This change, of course, occurs during photosynthesis. During cellular respiration, carbons from the glucose molecule are changed back into the carbon dioxide gas.





Conservation of Matter


Though matter can change states, and it often does, matter cannot be created or destroyed. Similar to the law of the conservation of energy, the law of conservation of mass states that the mass (or matter) of an isolated system will remain constant over time. This means that mass or matter cannot be created or destroyed, although it may be rearranged and changed into different types of substances. Hence, matter is continuously recycled, resulting in the so called "circle of life." The carbon and other elements of organisms are recycled to be used by other living organisms. This law also states that in a chemical reaction, or a biochemical reaction , as mass cannot be created or destroyed, the mass of the reactants must equal the mass of the products. In other words, the atoms in the starting materials must be equivalent to the atoms in the ending materials.





Vocabulary


biochemical reaction : Chemical reaction within a cell or organism; usually controlled by an enzyme.



boiling point : The temperature at which a liquid changes state into a gas.



gas : State of matter in which atoms or molecules have enough energy to move freely.



law of conservation of mass : Law that states that the mass of an isolated system will remain constant over time.



liquid : State of matter in which atoms or molecules are constantly in contact but have enough energy to keep changing positions relative to one another.



melting point : The temperature at which a solid changes state into a liquid.



solid : State of matter in which atoms or molecules do not have enough energy to move.



state of matter : Condition that matter is in, depending on how much energy its atoms or molecules have.





Summary


Matter can exist in one of several different states, including a gas, liquid, or solid state. States of matter differ in the amount of energy their molecules have. When matter recycles, it changes state by gaining or losing energy.

Chemical Reactions - Advanced

Understanding chemistry is essential to fully understand biology. Why?

A general understanding of chemistry is necessary to understand biology. Essentially, our cells are just thousands of chemicals — made of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur — in just the right combinations. And these chemicals combine through chemical reactions.





What are Chemical Reactions?


A chemical compound may be very different from the substances that combine to form it. For example, the element chlorine (Cl) is a poisonous gas, but when it combines with sodium (Na) to form sodium chloride (NaCl), it is no longer toxic. You may even eat it on your food. Sodium chloride is just table salt. What process changes a toxic chemical like chlorine into a much different substance like table salt?

A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances. The substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants . The substances that form as a result of a chemical reaction are called products . During the reaction, the reactants are used up to create the products. For example, when methane burns in oxygen, it releases carbon dioxide and water. In this reaction, the reactants are methane (CH 4 ) and oxygen (O 2 ), and the products are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O).





Chemical Equations


A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation. Using the same example, the burning of methane gas can be represented by the equation:

CH 4 + 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O.

The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the products and shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. If the reaction could also occur in the opposite direction, then two arrows, one pointing in each direction, or one arrow pointing in both directions, would be used. On each side of the arrow, a mixture of chemicals is indicated by the chemical symbols joined by a plus sign (+). The numbers preceding some of the chemical symbols (such as 2 O 2 ) indicate how many molecules of the chemicals are involved in the reaction. (If there is no number in front of a chemical symbol, it means that just one molecule is involved.)

In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change. There is the same amount of each element at the end of the reaction as there was at the beginning. This is reflected in the chemical equation for the reaction. The equation should be balanced. In a balanced equation, the same number of atoms of a given element appear on each side of the arrow. For example, in the equation above, there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow.





Types of Chemical Reactions


In general, a chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. In the methane reaction above, bonds are broken in methane and oxygen, and bonds are formed in carbon dioxide and water. A reaction like this, in which a compound or element burns in oxygen, is called a combustion reaction . This is just one of many possible types of chemical reactions. Other types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, and substitution reactions.

A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more chemical elements or compounds unite to form a more complex product. For example, nitrogen (N 2 ) and hydrogen (H 2 ) unite to form ammonia (NH 3 ):



N 2 + 3 H 2 → 2 NH 3 .

A decomposition reaction occurs when a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements. For example, water (H 2 O) breaks down into hydrogen (H 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ):



2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + O 2 .

A substitution reaction occurs when one element replaces another element in a compound. For example, sodium (Na + ) replaces hydrogen (H) in hydrochloric acid (HCl), producing sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydrogen gas (H 2 ):



2 Na + + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H 2 .





Redox Rections


Reduction-oxidation reactions, or redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed. This can be either a simple redox process, such as the oxidation of carbon into carbon dioxide or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen into methane, or a complex process such as the oxidation of glucose through a series of complex electron transfer processes during cellular respiration. Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion. Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.





Redox Reactions in Biology


Many important biological processes involve redox reactions, which frequently store and release energy. For example, photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into glucose and the oxidation of water into oxygen. This process stores the energy of sunlight in the bonds of sugars. The reverse reaction, cellular respiration, converts the energy in glucose into ATP. Cellular respiration involves the oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and the reduction of oxygen gas to water. This process depends on the reduction of NAD + to the electron carrier NADH, and the reverse oxidation of NADH to NAD + . The reduction of NAD + leads to the formation of a proton (H + ) gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP. NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) are electron carriers in biological systems. The term redox state is often used to describe the balance between NAD + /NADH and NADP + /NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).

How do you change one thing into another?

The bonds between the atoms need to be rearranged. That is the definition of a chemical reaction. And all chemical sections need energy to get started.





Chemical Reactions and Energy


All chemical reactions involve energy. Some chemical reactions consume energy, whereas other chemical reactions release energy. Chemical reactions can be either spontaneous, which do not require an input of energy, or non-spontaneous, which does require an input of some type of energy. Energy may be in the form of heat, light or electricity. Each of the energy changes that occur during a reaction are graphed in Figure below . In the reaction on the left, energy is released. In the reaction on the right, energy is consumed.

Figure 5.3

The exothermic reaction on the left releases energy. The endothermic reaction on the right consumes energy.





Thermodynamics


Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states the energy available after a chemical reaction is always less than that at the beginning of a reaction. This is also commonly referred to as entropy. Entropy can be described as the degree of disorder in a system . That is, as energy is transferred from one form to another, some of the energy is lost as heat, and the amount of available energy decreases. As the energy decreases, the disorder in the system increases, and, by definition, the entropy increases. Ice melting provides an example in which entropy increases. Entropy essentially is a measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.

Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic or exothermic, that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy. Enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system. The change in enthalpy is positive in endothermic reactions, and negative in exothermic processes.





Exothermic Reactions


Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic reactions . An example is the combustion of methane described at the beginning of this lesson. In organisms, exothermic reactions are called catabolic reactions . Catabolic reactions break down molecules into smaller units. An example is a decomposition reaction, such as the breakdown of glucose molecules for energy. Exothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:

Reactants → Products + Heat.





Endothermic Reactions


Chemical reactions that consume energy are called endothermic reactions . Energy is usually absorbed from the surroundings as heat. An example is the synthesis of ammonia, described above. In organisms, endothermic reactions are called anabolic reactions . Anabolic reactions construct molecules from smaller units. An example is the synthesis of proteins from amino acids. Endothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:

Reactants + Heat → Products.



Figure 5.4

This pack gets cold due to an endothermic reaction.





Endothermic Organisms


In biological systems, the term endothermic is a metabolic term related to maintenance of body temperature. An endothermic animals is an organism that produces heat through internal means, a process known as endothermy. Animals may do this through muscle shivering or increasing metabolism. These animals do to absorb heat from their surroundings, so the term endothermic has distinct uses related to chemical reactions or maintenance of body temperature. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy. Ectothermic animals ( cold-blooded ) do absorb heat from their surroundings.





Vocabulary


anabolic reaction : Endothermic reaction that occurs in organisms; chemical reaction that builds new molecules and/or stores energy.



catabolic reaction : Chemical reaction that breaks down more complex organic molecules into simpler substances; usually releases energy.



decomposition reaction : Type of chemical reaction in which a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements.



endothermic reaction : Any chemical reaction that consumes energy.



enthalpy : A measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system.



entropy : A measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.



exothermic reaction : Any chemical reaction that releases energy.





Summary


Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics.

Some chemical reactions are exothermic, which means they release energy. Other chemical reactions are endothermic, which means they consume energy.

Catabolic and anabolic reactions occur in cells/organisms.

Enzymes and Activation Energy - Advanced


Explain the importance of enzymes in organisms, and describe how enzymes work.

State factors that affect the rate of chemical reactions.





What is the energy needed for biochemical reactions?

Is it light or heat? It could be either. But whatever form energy takes, every single biochemical reaction in your body - and there are trillions of these reactions (or more) every split second, needs energy to start or activate. And that is known as activation energy.





Activation Energy


Regardless of whether reactions are exothermic reactions or endothermic reactions , they all need energy to get started. This energy is called activation energy . Activation energy is like the push you need to start moving down a slide. The push gives you enough energy to start moving. Once you start, you keep moving without being pushed again. Activation energy is defined as the energy that must be overcome in order for a chemical reaction to occur, or the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction. The concept of activation energy is illustrated in Figure below .

An overview of activation energy can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbIaK6PLrRM (1:16).



Click on the image above for more content



Figure 5.5

To start this reaction, a certain amount of energy is required, called the activation energy. How much activation energy is required depends on the nature of the reaction and the conditions under which the reaction takes place. Activation energy can be thought of as the height of the energy barrier between the reactants and the products .



Why do reactions need energy to get started? In order for reactions to occur, three things must happen, and they all require energy:

Reactant molecules must collide. To collide, they must move, so they need kinetic energy.

Unless reactant molecules are positioned correctly, intermolecular forces may push them apart. To overcome these forces and move together requires more energy.

If reactant molecules collide and move together, there must be enough energy left for them to react.





Rates of Chemical Reactions


The rates at which chemical reactions take place in organisms are very important. Chemical reactions in organisms are involved in processes ranging from the contraction of muscles to the digestion of food. For example, when you wave goodbye, it requires repeated contractions of muscles in your arm over a period of a couple of seconds. A huge number of reactions must take place in that time, so each reaction cannot take longer than a few milliseconds. If the reactions took much longer, you might not finish waving until sometime next year.

Factors that help reactant molecules collide and react speed up chemical reactions. These factors include the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which the reactions occur.

Reactions are usually faster at higher concentrations of reactants. The more reactant molecules there are in a given space, the more likely they are to collide and react.

Reactions are usually faster at higher temperatures. Reactant molecules at higher temperatures have more energy to move, collide, and react.





Vocabulary


activation energy : Energy needed for a chemical reaction to get started.



endothermic reaction : Any chemical reaction that consumes energy.



exothermic reaction : Any chemical reaction that releases energy.



product : Substance that forms as a result of a chemical reaction.



reactant : Substance involved in a chemical reaction that is present at the beginning of the reaction.





Summary


All chemical reactions require activation energy, which is the energy needed to get a reaction started.

Rates of chemical reactions depend on factors such as the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which reactions occur. Both factors affect the ability of reactant molecules to react.

Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions - Advanced


Explain the importance of enzymes in organisms, and describe how enzymes work.





What is a biological catalyst?

This super fast train can obviously reach great speeds. And there's a lot of technology that helps this train go fast. Speaking of helping things go fast brings us to enzymes. Life could not exist without enzymes. Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions.





Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions


Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .

Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control. They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions. Instead, they may be used over and over again. Unlike other catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for a particular chemical reaction. They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions.

Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up biochemical reactions. They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous. A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but less than a second with the enzyme.

An overview of enzymes can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E90D4BmaVJM (9:43).



Click on the image above for more content





How Enzymes Work


How do enzymes speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically? Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions. This is illustrated in Figure below . The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme.

An animation of how enzymes work can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZD5xsOKres (2:02).



Click on the image above for more content



Figure 5.6

The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) and oxygen (O 2 ). The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water (H 2 O). Energy is also released during the reaction. The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start. Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme.



Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example:

Enzymes bring reactants together so they don’t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random. Enzymes bind both reactant molecules (called substrates ), tightly and specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the active site ( Figure below ). This forms an enzyme-substrate complex.

By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart. This allows the molecules to interact with less energy.

Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that have lower activation energy.





Figure 5.7

This enzyme molecule binds reactant molecules—called substrate—at its active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This brings the reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can occur. After the reaction, the products are released from the enzyme’s active site. This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional reactions.



The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings. Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments.

Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment (low pH) of the stomach help break down proteins into smaller molecules. The main digestive enzyme in the stomach is pepsin , which works best at a pH of about 1.5). These enzymes would not work optimally at other pHs. Trypsin is another enzyme in the digestive system which break protein chains in the food into smaller parts. Trypsin works in the small intestine, which is not an acidic environment. Trypsin's optimum pH is about 8.

Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures. For example, most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body temperature of 98.6˚F (37˚C). Many enzymes lose function at lower and higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, an enzyme’s shape deteriorates, and only when the temperature comes back to normal does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity.





Importance of Enzymes


Enzymes are involved in most of the chemical reactions that take place in organisms. About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes, but the number may be even higher. In animals, an important function of enzymes is to help digest food. Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can use. Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive.





Vocabulary


active site : Site on the enzyme where the reaction occurs.



biochemical reaction : Chemical reaction within a cell or organism; usually controlled by an enzyme.



enzyme : Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.



pepsin : The main digestive enzyme in the stomach; degrades food proteins into peptides.



reactant : Substance involved in a chemical reaction that is present at the beginning of the reaction.



substrates : The reactants in an enzyme catalyzed reaction.



trypsin : Digestive enzyme which break protein chains in food into smaller peptide fragments; a serine protease, cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline.





Summary


Enzymes are needed to speed up chemical reactions in organisms. They work by lowering the activation energy of reactions.

Enzymes position substrates into active sites.

Various conditions affect enzyme function. Pepsin and trypsin are two digestive enzymes that work in contrasting environments.

Introduction




This caterpillar is busily munching its way through leaf after leaf. In fact, caterpillars do little more than eat, day and night. Like all living things, they need food to provide their cells with energy. The caterpillar will soon go through an amazing transformation to become a beautiful butterfly. These changes require a lot of energy.

Like this caterpillar and all other living things, you need energy to power everything you do. Whether it’s running a race or blinking an eye, it takes energy. In fact, every cell of your body constantly needs energy to carry out life processes. You probably know that you get energy from the food you eat, but where does food come from? How does it come to contain energy, and how do your cells get the energy from food? When you read this chapter, you will learn the answers to these questions.

Photosynthesis


All living things require an ongoing source of energy to do the work of life. You often see energy in action on a large scale: a whale breaches, apple blossoms swell and burst, a firefly glows, or an inky cap mushrooms overnight. However, energy works constantly to maintain life on a very small scale as well. Inside each cell of every organism, energy assembles chains of information and constructs cellular architecture. It moves tiny charged particles and giant protein molecules. Moreover, it builds and powers cell systems for awareness, response, and reproduction. All life’s work requires energy.

Physics tells us that organized systems, such as living organisms, tend to disorder without a constant input of energy. You have direct, everyday experience with this law of nature: after a week of living in your room, you must spend energy in order to return it to its previous, ordered state. Tides and rain erode your sandcastles, so you must work to rebuild them. And your body, after a long hike or big game, must have more fuel to keep going. Living things show amazing complexity and intricate beauty, but if their source of energy fails, they suffer injury, illness, and eventually death.

Physics also tells us that, although energy can be captured or transformed, it inevitably degrades, becoming heat, a less useful form of energy. This is why organisms require a constant input of energy; the work they must do uses up the energy they take in. Energy, unlike materials, cannot be recycled. The story of life is a story of energy flow – its capture, transformation, use for work, and loss as heat.

Energy , the ability to do work, can take many forms: heat, nuclear, electrical, magnetic, light, and chemical energy. Life runs on chemical energy - the energy stored in covalent bonds between atoms in a molecule. Where do organisms get their chemical energy? That depends. Most organisms get their energy from the food they make, eat or absorb. Plants, for example, make their own "food" through the process of photosynthesis. When we eat a plant, such as lettuce or a tomato, we acquire energy. This energy is in the form of glucose , a simple sugar. Or the energy may be in the form of a starch, which we eat and then our body breaks down into glucose. This glucose then must be converted into usable chemical energy. Chemical energy in our cells is ATP. Glucose is converted into ATP during cellular respiration.



Figure 6.1

This diagram depicts photosynthesis. CO 2 and H 2 O enter the plant leaf cell, and in the presence of solar energy, these reactants are converted into the products O 2 and glucose.

Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration


What is the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration? Does photosynthesis have to occur prior to cellular respiration? No. Though it is true that the products of photosynthesis are the reactants of cellular respiration, the two can occur simultaneously in the plant cell. The light reactions of photosynthesis also obviously occur during daylight hours, while the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis and the reactions of cellular respiration can occur whenever reactants are available.



Figure 6.2

This diagram compares and contrasts photosynthesis (in the chloroplast) and cellular respiration (in the mitochondria). It also shows how the two processes are related.





Vocabulary


ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ): Energy-carrying molecule that cells use to power their metabolic processes; energy-currency of the cell.



cellular respiration : Metabolic process which transfers chemical energy from glucose (a deliverable fuel molecule) to ATP (a usable energy-rich molecule); most efficient in the presence of oxygen (aerobic).



energy : Property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work



glucose : The carbohydrate product of photosynthesis; serves as the universal fuel for life; C 6 H 12 O 6 .



photosynthesis : The process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose and oxygen, using sunlight for energy.





Summary


All organisms require a constant input of energy to do the work of life; life runs on chemical energy.

Energy cannot be recycled; energy must be constantly captured by organisms in an ecosystem, transformed and passed to other organisms.

Most energy is lost to the environment as heat.

Autotrophs vs. Heterotrophs - Advanced


Analyze the way in which autotrophs obtain energy and evaluate the importance of autotrophs to energy for all life.

Explain the relationship between autotrophs and heterotrophs.





Name one major difference between a plant and an animal.

There are many differences, but in terms of energy, it all starts with sunlight. Plants absorb the energy from the sun and turn it into food. You can sit in the sun for hours and hours. You will feel warm, but you're not going to absorb any energy. You have to eat to obtain your energy. You, of course, can go to the kitchen and cook something to eat. Other animals can also eat, but a plant cannot.





How Do Organisms Get Energy? Autotrophs vs. Heterotrophs


Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways.

Autotrophs, shown in the Figure below , store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they produce themselves. Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules. Food provides both the energy to do work and the carbon to build the organic structures from cells to organisms. Because most autotrophs transform sunlight to make or synthesize food, we call the process they use photosynthesis . The food produced via this process is glucose. Only three groups of organisms - plants, algae, and some bacteria - are capable of this life-giving energy transformation. Autotrophs make food for their own use, but they make enough to support other life as well. Almost all other organisms depend absolutely on these three groups for the food they produce. The producers , as autotrophs are also known, begin food chains which feed all life. Food chains will be discussed in the Ecology concepts.



Figure 6.3

Photosynthetic autotrophs, which make food for more than 99% of the organisms on earth, include only three groups of organisms: plants such as the redwood tree (a), algae such as kelp (b), and certain bacteria like this Anabaena (c).



Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it. For this reason, heterotrophs are also known as consumers . Consumers include all animals and fungi and many protists and bacteria. They consume either autotrophs or other heterotrophs. Heterotrophs show great diversity and may appear far more fascinating than producers. But heterotrophs are limited by their utter dependence on those autotrophs which originally made the food. If plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria vanished from Earth, animals, fungi, and other heterotrophs would soon disappear as well. All life requires a constant input of energy. Only autotrophs can transform that ultimate, solar source into the chemical energy in food which powers life, as shown in Figure below .



Figure 6.4

Food chains carry energy from producers (autotrophs) to consumers (heterotrophs). 99% of energy for life comes from the sun via photosynthesis. Note that only nutrients recycle. Energy must continue to flow into the system. Though this food chains "ends" with decomposers, do decomposers, in fact, digest matter from each level of the food chain? (See the Energy Transfer: Decomposers (Advanced) concept).



Photosynthesis provides over 99% of the energy supply for life on Earth. A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis , and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure below . Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or “black smokers.” There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth’s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food.



Figure 6.5

Tubeworms deep in the Gulf of Mexico get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria living within their tissues. No digestive systems needed!



Phototrophs are organisms that capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy inside their cell. Most phototrophs are the autotrophs that perform photosynthesis, which are also known as photoautotrophs. These organisms have the ability to fix carbon from carbon dioxide into organic compounds, such as glucose. Chemotrophs , on the other hand, do not get their energy from carbon. These are organisms that break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell through chemosynthesis. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic (chemoautotrophs) or heterotrophic (chemoheterotrophs). Chemoautotrophs derive their energy from chemical reactions, and synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Chemoheterotrophs are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. The various types of metabolisms are discussed in the Prokaryotes: Nutrition and Metabolism (Advanced) concept.



Figure 6.6

This flowchart helps to determine if a species is an autotroph or a heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph. For example, “Carbon obtained from elsewhere?” asks if the source of carbon is another organism. If the answer is “yes”, the organism is heterotrophic. If the answer is “no,” the organisms is autotrophic.

Summary


Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules.

Food provides both the energy to do life’s work and the carbon to build life’s bodies.

Autotrophs make their own carbohydrate foods, transforming sunlight in photosynthesis or transferring chemical energy from inorganic molecules in chemosynthesis.

Heterotrophs consume organic molecules originally made by autotrophs.

All life depends absolutely upon autotrophs to make food molecules.

Energy Carrying Molecules - Advanced


Discuss the importance of glucose to all life on earth.

Compare the energy-carrying role of ATP to that of glucose.

Explain the roles of chlorophyll and NADPH as sources of energy for life.





When do you need lots of energy?

To run a marathon, probably. Where does this extra energy come from? Remember that energy from the sun is transformed into the carbohydrate glucose. Carbohydrate loading is a strategy used by endurance athletes to maximize the storage of energy, in the form of glycogen, in the muscles. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, which is then turned into ATP through the process of cellular respiration.





Food and Other Energy-Carrying Molecules


You know that the chicken you had for lunch contained protein molecules. But do you know that the atoms in those proteins could easily have formed the color in a dragonfly’s eye, the heart of a water flea, and the whiplike tail of a Euglena before they hit your plate as sleek fish muscle? Food consists of organic (carbon-containing) molecules which store energy in the chemical bonds between their atoms. Organisms use the atoms of food molecules to build larger organic molecules including proteins, DNA, and fats, and use the energy in food to power life processes. By breaking the bonds in food molecules, cells release energy to build new compounds. Although some energy dissipates as heat at each energy transfer, much of it is stored in the newly made molecules. Chemical bonds in organic molecules are a reservoir of the energy used to make them. Fueled by the energy from food molecules, cells can combine and recombine the elements of life to form thousands of different molecules. Both the energy (despite some loss) and the materials (despite being reorganized) pass from producer to consumer – perhaps from algal tails, to water flea hearts, to dragonfly eye colors, to fish muscle, to you!

The process of photosynthesis , which usually begins the flow of energy through life, uses many different kinds of energy-carrying molecules to transform sunlight energy into chemical energy and build food.





Chlorophyll and NADPH


Some carrier molecules hold energy briefly, quickly shifting it like a hot potato to other molecules. This strategy allows energy to be released in small, controlled amounts. An example is chlorophyll, the green pigment present in most plants which absorbs solar energy and helps convert that energy into chemical energy. When a chlorophyll molecule absorbs light energy, electrons are excited and “jump” to a higher energy level. The excited electrons then bounce to a series of carrier molecules, losing a small amount of energy at each step. Most of the “lost” energy powers some small cellular task, such as moving ions across a membrane or building up another molecule. Another short-term energy carrier important to photosynthesis, NADPH , holds chemical energy a bit longer but soon that energy is used to help to build sugar. NADPH is the reduced form of NADP + , Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. NADP + accepts an electron at the end of the light reactions electron transport chain of photosynthesis. Two related short term energy carriers, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH 2 (flavin adenine dinucleotide) are used during cellular respiration .





Glucose and ATP


Two of the most important energy-carrying molecules are glucose and ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ). These are nearly universal fuels throughout the living world and both are also key players in photosynthesis.

A molecule of glucose, which has the chemical formula C 6 H 12 O 6 , carries a packet of chemical energy just the right size for transport and uptake by cells. In your body, glucose is the “deliverable” form of energy, carried in your blood through capillaries to each of your roughly 100 trillion cells. Glucose is also the carbohydrate produced by photosynthesis, and as such is the near-universal food for life.

ATP molecules store smaller quantities of energy, but each releases just the right amount to actually do work within a cell. Muscle cell proteins, for example, pull each other with the energy released when bonds in ATP break open (discussed below). The process of photosynthesis also makes and uses ATP - for energy to build glucose. ATP, then, is the useable form of energy for your cells.



Figure 6.7

Glucose, C 6 H 12 O 6 , is the energy-rich product of photosynthesis, a universal food for life. It is also a six-carbon monosaccharide, or simple sugar. Glucose is the primary form in which your bloodstream delivers energy to every cell in your body, where it is converted into ATP. The six carbons are numbered.



Why do we need both glucose and ATP? Why don’t plants just make ATP and be done with it? If energy were money, ATP would be a quarter. Enough money to operate a parking meter or washing machine. Glucose would be a dollar bill (or $10) – much easier to carry around in your wallet, but too large to do the actual work of paying for parking or washing. Just as we find several denominations of money useful, organisms need several “denominations” of energy – a smaller quantity for work within cells, and a larger quantity for stable storage, transport, and delivery to cells.

Let’s take a closer look at a molecule of ATP. Although it carries less energy than glucose, its structure is more complex. “A” in ATP refers to the majority of the molecule – adenosine – a combination of a nitrogenous base and a five-carbon sugar. “T” and “P” indicate the three phosphates, linked by bonds which hold the energy actually used by cells. Usually, only the outermost bond breaks to release or spend energy for cellular work.

An ATP molecule, shown in the Figure below , is like a rechargeable battery: its energy can be used by the cell when it breaks apart into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate, and then the “worn-out battery” ADP can be recharged using new energy to attach a new phosphate and rebuild ATP. The materials are recyclable, but recall that energy is not! ADP can be further reduced to AMP (adenosine monophosphate and phosphate, releasing additional energy. As with ADT "recharged" to ATP, AMP can be recharged to ADP.

How much energy does it cost to do your body’s work? A single cell uses about 10 million ATP molecules per second, and recycles all of its ATP molecules about every 20-30 seconds.



Figure 6.8

An arrow shows the bond between two phosphate groups in an ATP molecule. When this bond breaks, its chemical energy can do cellular work. The resulting ADP molecule is recycled when new energy attaches another phosphate, rebuilding ATP.



Keep these energy-carrying molecules in mind as we look more carefully at the process which originally captures the energy to build them: photosynthesis. Recall that it provides nearly all of the food (energy and materials) for life. Actually, as you will see, we are indebted to photosynthesis for even more than just the energy and building blocks for life.

Photosynthesis: The Most Important Chemical Reaction for Life on Earth


What do pizza, campfires, dolphins, automobiles, and glaciers have in common? In the following section, you’ll learn that all five rely on photosynthesis, some in more ways than one. Photosynthesis is often considered the most important chemical reaction for life on earth. Let’s delve into how this process works and why we are so indebted to it.

The Photosynthesis Song can be heard at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1_uez5WX1o (1:52).



Click on the image above for more content

Photosynthesis involves a complex series of chemical reactions, each of which convert one substance to another. These reactions taken as a whole can be summarized in a single symbolic representation – as shown in the chemical equation below.



We can substitute words for the chemical symbols. Then the equation appears as below.



Like all chemical equations, this equation for photosynthesis shows reactants connected by plus signs on the left and products, also connected by plus signs, on the right. An arrow indicating the process or chemical change leads from the reactants to the products, and conditions necessary for the chemical reaction are written above the arrow. Note that the same kinds of atoms, and number of atoms, are found on both sides of the equation, but the kinds of compounds they form change.

You use chemical reactions every time you cook or bake. You add together ingredients (the reactants), place them in specific conditions (often heat), and enjoy the results (the products). A recipe for chocolate chip cookies written in chemical equation form is shown below.



Compare this familiar recipe to photosynthesis below.



The equation shows that the “ingredients” for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide, water, and light energy. Plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria take in light from the sun, molecules of carbon dioxide from the air, and water molecules from their environment and combine these reactants to produce food (glucose).

Of course, light, carbon dioxide, and water mix in the air even without plants. But they do not chemically change to make food without very specific necessary conditions which are found only in the cells of photosynthetic organisms. Necessary conditions include:

enzymes - proteins which speed up chemical reactions

chlorophyll - a pigment within plant cells which absorbs light

chloroplasts - organelles whose membranes embed chlorophyll, accessory pigments, and enzymes in patterns which maximize photosynthesis



Within plant cells or algal cells, chloroplasts organize the enzymes, chlorophyll, and accessory pigment molecules necessary for photosynthesis.



Figure 6.9

Within plant cells or algal cells, chloroplasts organize the enzymes, chlorophyll, and accessory pigment molecules necessary for photosynthesis.



When the reactants meet inside chloroplasts, or the very similar cells of blue-green bacteria, chemical reactions combine them to form two products: energy-rich glucose molecules and molecules of oxygen gas. Photosynthetic organisms store the glucose (usually as starch) and release the oxygen gas into the atmosphere as waste.

Let’s review the chemical equation for photosynthesis once more, this time at the level of atoms as in the equation below.



Look closely at its primary purpose: storing energy in the chemical bonds of food molecules. The source of energy for food is sunlight energy. The source of carbon atoms for the food molecules is carbon dioxide from the air, and the source of hydrogen atoms is water. Inside the cells of plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, chlorophyll, and enzymes use the light energy to rearrange the atoms of the reactants to form the products, molecules of glucose and oxygen gas. Light energy is thus transformed into chemical energy, stored in the bonds which bind six atoms each of carbon and oxygen to twelve atoms of hydrogen – forming a molecule of glucose. This energy rich carbohydrate molecule becomes food for the plants, algae, and bacteria themselves as well as for the heterotrophs which feed on them.

One last detail: why do “6”s precede the CO 2 , H 2 O, and O 2 ? Look carefully, and you will see that this “balances” the equation: the numbers of each kind of atom on each side of the arrow are equal. Six molecules each of CO 2 and H 2 O make 1 molecule of glucose and 6 molecules of oxygen gas.



Figure 6.10

The two stages of photosynthesis are the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Do you see how the two stages are related?





Historical Perspective


Life requires photosynthesis for fuel and for the oxygen to burn that fuel. Since the Industrial Revolution (late 18th and early 19th centuries), we humans have relied on products of ancient photosynthesis for enormous quantities of fossil fuel energy. And, knowingly or not, we have also benefited from photosynthesis to remove the carbon dioxide produced when we burn those fuels. So it may not surprise you that biologists have studied this critical process in great detail.

Although photosynthesis may seem straightforward in this form, such simplicity is deceiving for two reasons. First, the photosynthesis equation summarizes dozens of individual chemical reactions involving many intermediate compounds. And second, just discovering major players like CO 2 and O 2 was challenging, because our ordinary senses cannot detect these molecules in “thin air!”

How do we know that the chemical reaction in photosynthesis really happens? Two famous historical experiments help us begin to understand this process. In the 17 th century, people who thought about it at all assumed that plants get their food from the soil. Many people, encouraged by sellers of “plant food,” still do. In 1638, Jan Baptist Van Helmont planted a 5 pound willow tree, like the one shown in the Figure below , in a 200 pound tub of soil. After 5 years of watering the plant, he weighed both again. The willow had gained over 160 pounds, but the soil had lost only 2 ounces. Van Helmont concluded that plants do not get their materials from soil, and inferred that they grow using materials from water (which he did not measure). As you know now, he was half right. Although soil provides important nutrients to plants, it supplies neither the energy nor the vast majority of the materials to build the plant. We must excuse him, because no one in the 17 th century knew that carbon atoms form the basis of life, or that they float around in air in the form of carbon dioxide.



Figure 6.11

In the 17 th century, Jan Van Helmont, a Flemish chemist, physiologist, and physician, weighed and potted a willow tree, showing that plants do not get food from the soil.



In the late 1770s, minister and natural philosopher Joseph Priestley burned a candle in a jar of air and observed that the candle burned out long before it ran out of wax. A similar experiment with a mouse resulted in the mouse’s death. Priestley suggested that animals, like candles, “injure” the air. Adding a mint plant, as shown in Figure below , however, “restored” the air which had been “injured” by the mouse or the candle. Only later, after many chemistry experiments, did Priestley publish his discovery of “dephlogisticated air.” But in his studies of mice, plants, and candles, he had shown that plants produce, and animals consume, oxygen gas.



Figure 6.12

Joseph Priestly's bell jar experiment.



During the 20 th century, scientists learned that photosynthesis involves much more than just the three reactants, the three necessary conditions, and the two products shown in the equation. Using powerful microscopes, scientists narrowed the process to one type of organelle within the plant – the chloroplast.

For a detailed animation of the complete photosynthesis process, see http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/photosynthesis/first.htm .





Vocabulary


chlorophyll : The primary pigment of photosynthesis; found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.



chloroplast : The organelle of photosynthesis; site of photosynthesis.



enzyme : Chemical, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions in organisms; a biological catalyst.





Summary


The photosynthesis chemical equation states that the reactants (carbon dioxide, water and sunlight), yield two products, glucose and oxygen gas.

The single chemical equation represents the overall process of photosynthesis. It also summarizes many individual chemical reactions that were understood only after hundreds of years of scientific exploration.

Chloroplasts are the organelles within plant and algal cells that organize enzymes and pigments so that the chemical reactions proceed efficiently.

Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs sunlight energy.

The Chloroplast - Advanced


Describe the structure and function of chloroplasts, thylakoids, and pigments.

Explain how electron carrier molecules form electron transport chains.





What do pancakes and chloroplasts have in common?

The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis. Part of the photosynthesis reactions occur in an internal membrane within the organelle. Many of the pigments and other molecules necessary for photosynthesis are embedded within these internal membranes, The chloroplast contains many of these internal membranes, allowing numerous photosynthetic reactions to occur simultaneously, and making photosynthesis very efficient. These internal membranes stack on top of each other, just like a stack of pancakes.





Chloroplasts: Theaters for Photosynthesis


If you examine a single leaf of the aquatic plant Elodea , shown in Figure below , under a microscope, you will see within each cell dozens of small green ovals. These are chloroplasts , the organelles which conduct photosynthesis in plants and algae. Chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria, containing their own circular DNA and ribosomes. In fact, the Theory of Endosymbiosis holds that chloroplasts were once independently living bacteria (prokaryotes). So when we say that photosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts, we speak not only of the organelles within plants and algae, but also of some bacteria – in other words, virtually all photosynthetic autotrophs.



Figure 6.13

Elodea (above), like all plants and algae, consists of cells which contain organelles called chloroplasts (small green ovals). If you look carefully at living cells through a microscope, you may see the chloroplasts moving slowly around the cell edges. The plant itself may not move, but this cyclosis hints at all the action within plant cells. Remember that chloroplasts are one of the main differences between plant and animal cells; animal cells do not contain chloroplasts.



Both chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria contain grana, neat stacks of flattened sac-shaped membrane compartments called thylakoids . Thylakoids can be considered a sub-organelle within the chloroplast. Between the chloroplast membrane and the grana is an aqueous fluid known as stroma . Thylakoids, especially the thylakoid membrane, organize patterns of proteins and other molecules which conduct photosynthesis, as shown in Figure below . In addition to enzymes, two basic types of molecules - pigments and electron carriers – are significant in this process. You can take a video tour of a chloroplast at Encyclopedia Britannica: Chloroplast : http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/16440/Chloroplasts-circulate-within-plant-cells .



Figure 6.14

The structure of a chloroplast shows how membrane and molecular architecture helps life processes. A chloroplast consists of thylakoid membranes surrounded by stroma. The thylakoids stack on top of each other, like a stack of pancakes. The thylakoid stacks arrange chlorophyll, accessory pigment molecules, and photosynthetic proteins to capture sunlight and allow a concentration of ions within the sacs. You can see the green color of the chlorophyll. You cannot see the electron carriers, sequenced within the sac membranes, but their arrangement helps harvest small amounts of energy from excited electrons. The thylakoid membranes contain molecules of the green pigment chlorophyll.





Pigments and Electron Carriers


Pigment molecules, often arranged together with proteins in large, complex photosystems within the thylakoid membrane, absorb specific wavelengths of light energy and reflect others; therefore, they appear colored. The most common photosynthetic pigment is chlorophyll , which absorbs blue-violet and red wavelengths of light, and reflects green. Various types of chlorophyll exist, including chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Accessory pigments absorb other colors of light and then transfer the energy to chlorophyll. These include xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (orange).

Electron carrier molecules are usually arranged in electron transport chains (ETCs), also within the thylakoid membrane. These accept and pass along energy-carrying electrons in small steps ( Figure below ). In this way, they produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy. Electrons in transport chains behave much like a ball bouncing down a set of stairs – a little energy is lost with each bounce. However, the energy “lost” at each step in an electron transport chain accomplishes a little bit of work, including the active transport of H + ions from the stroma into the thylakoid, which eventually results in the synthesis of ATP. Chlorophyll a is the primary electron donor in the electron transport chain.



Figure 6.15

This figure shows the light reactions of photosynthesis. This stage of photosynthesis begins with photosystem II (so named because it was discovered after photosystem I). Find the two electrons (2 e - ) in photosystem II, and then follow them through the electron transport chain (also called the electron transfer chain) to the formation of NADPH. Where do the hydrogen ions (H + ) come from that help make ATP?



Now that you’ve met some of the key players and explored the chloroplast, let’s put them together to see how the photosynthetic process unfolds. We will divide the process into two basic sets of reactions, known as the light reactions, which of course uses sunlight, and the Calvin cycle, which uses carbon dioxide. As you study the details, refer frequently to the chemical equation of photosynthesis. In the first stage, you’ll discover how chloroplasts transform light energy, and why we owe our ability to breathe to plants!

Chloroplasts have stacks of internal membranes called thylakoids; these membranes sequence pigments and electron carrier molecules for efficient photosynthesis.

Thylakoids create compartments, which allow concentration gradients to store energy.

Pigment molecules absorb specific wavelengths (colors) of light; chlorophyll is the primary pigment in photosynthesis.

Electron carrier molecules form electron transport chains, which transfer energy in small steps so that the energy can be stored or used for work.

The Light Reactions - Advanced


Trace the flow of energy and materials through the Light Reactions, including chemiosmosis.





Oxygen has been described as a "waste product." How is this possible?

You could argue that oxygen is one of the most important, if not THE most important molecule necessary for life. However, oxygen is essentially just a waste product of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is a "leftover" from a necessary part of the process. All the oxygen that is necessary to maintain most forms of life just happens to be released from the plant during this process.





Photosynthesis Stage I: The Light Reactions: in which Chloroplasts Capture Sunlight Chemical Energy…


Every second, the sun fuses over 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 tons of helium, converting over 4 tons of helium (4.3 billion kg) into light and heat energy. Countless tiny packets of that light energy travel 93 million miles (150 million km) through space, and about 1% of the light which reaches the Earth’s surface participates in photosynthesis. Sunlight is the source of energy for photosynthesis, and the first set of reactions which begin the process requires light – thus the name, "Light Reactions", or Light-dependent Reactions. This light is absorbed by chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in the plant cell.



Figure 6.16

The pigment molecule, chlorophyll, shown here, appears green because its electrons absorb blue-violet and red light and reflect green, orange, and yellow light. This diagram shows that there are actually several different kinds of chlorophyll (a,b, and d shown here) in plants.





Figure 6.17

Each kind of pigment absorbs specific wavelengths (colors) of light (dashed lines). Sunlight contains many different wavelengths, which you see when they separate into a rainbow. Not all colors of light are used in photosynthesis (solid line). Most plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria appear green because they reflect green wavelengths. Their pigments have absorbed the violet-blue and red wavelengths. The amount of photosynthesis depends on the wavelength of light available. Beta-carotene is another type of pigment that absorbs sunlight.



The pigment molecule chlorophyll of leaf cells appears green because its electrons absorb blue-violet and red light and reflect green, orange, and yellow light. There are actually several different kinds of chlorophyll (a,b, and d) in plants. Each kind of pigment absorbs specific wavelengths (colors) of light. Sunlight contains many different wavelengths, which you see when they separate into a rainbow. Not all colors of light are used in photosynthesis. Most plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria appear green because they reflect green wavelengths. Their pigments have absorbed the violet-blue and red wavelengths. The amount of photosynthesis depends on the wavelength of light available. Cartenoids are also pigments that absorb sunlight.

When light strikes chlorophyll (or an accessory pigment) within the chloroplast, the energy is absorbed and transferred to electrons in the chlorophyll. Essentially, sunlight energizes or "excites," electrons within the chlorophyll molecule. Photosystem II is also known as P680, with P standing for pigment and 680 referring to the absorption maximum in the red part of the visible spectrum (680 nm). The primary electron donor in P680 receives excitation energy by absorbing a photon of light. These excited electrons jump up to higher energy levels and enter the electron transport chain ; they have absorbed or captured, and now carry, that energy. These high energy electrons are holding the energy that will be be transferred to glucose. In essence, these high energy electrons are holding the energy needed to support life.





...And Change the Rules of Chemistry for Life!


The excited electrons leave chlorophyll to participate in further reactions, leaving the chlorophyll “at a loss”; eventually they must be replaced. That replacement process also requires light, working with an enzyme complex to split water molecules. In this process of photolysis (“splitting by light”), H 2 O molecules are broken into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms. The electrons replace those originally lost from chlorophyll. Hydrogen ions and the high-energy electrons from chlorophyll will carry on the energy transformation drama after the Light Reactions are over.

The oxygen atoms, however, form oxygen gas, which is a waste product of photosynthesis ( Figure below ). The oxygen given off supplies most of the oxygen in our atmosphere. Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth’s atmosphere lacked oxygen altogether, and this highly reactive gas was toxic to the many organisms living at the time. Something had to change! Most contemporary organisms rely on oxygen for efficient respiration. So plants don’t just “restore” the air, as Joseph Priestley suggested. They also had a major role in creating it!



Figure 6.18

Photosynthesis has made the Earth’s atmosphere today very different from what it was 2-3 billion years ago, by giving off oxygen gas as waste. The table to the right shows the composition of today’s atmosphere. On the left is an Apollo 17 photograph of Earth.



To summarize, chloroplasts “capture” sunlight energy in two ways. Light “excites” electrons in pigment molecules, and light provides the energy to split water molecules, providing more electrons as well as hydrogen ions.

Now let’s follow those excited electrons…





How Do Chloroplasts Convert Light Energy to Chemical Energy?


Excited electrons which have absorbed light energy are unstable. However, the highly organized electron carrier molecules embedded in chloroplast membranes order the flow of these electrons, directing them through electron transport chains (ETCs). At each transfer, small amounts of energy released by the electrons are captured and put to work or stored. Some is also lost as heat with each transfer, but overall the light reactions are extremely efficient at capturing light energy and transforming it to chemical energy.

Two sequential transport chains harvest the energy of excited electrons, as shown in Figure below .

First, starting with photosystem II, electrons pass down an ETC which captures their energy and uses it to pump hydrogen ions by active transport into the thylakoids. These concentrated ions store potential energy by forming a chemiosmotic gradient or electrochemical gradient – a higher concentration of both positive charge and hydrogen inside the thylakoid than outside. The gradient formed by the H + ions is known as a chemiosmotic gradient. Picture this energy buildup of H + as a dam holding back a waterfall. Like water flowing through a hole in the dam, hydrogen ions “slide down” their concentration gradient through a membrane protein which acts as both ion channel and enzyme. As they flow, the ion channel/enzyme ATP synthase uses their energy to chemically bond a phosphate group to ADP, making ATP.

Light re-energizes the electrons in photosystem I, and they travel down a second electron transport chain (ETC), eventually bonding hydrogen ions to NADP + to form a more stable energy storage molecule, NADPH. NADPH is sometimes called “hot hydrogen,” and its energy and hydrogen atoms will be used to help build sugar in the second stage of photosynthesis. Whereas photosystem II has an absorption maximum at 680nm, photosystem I has an absorption maximum at 700nm, and is known as P700.





Figure 6.19

Membrane architecture: The large colored carrier molecules form electron transport chains that capture small amounts of energy from excited electrons in order to store it in ATP and NADPH. Follow the energy pathways: light → electrons → NADPH (blue line) and light → electrons → concentrated H + → ATP (red line). Note the intricate organization of the chloroplast.



NADPH and ATP molecules now store the energy from excited electrons – energy which was originally sunlight – in chemical bonds. Thus chloroplasts, with their orderly arrangement of pigments, enzymes, and electron transport chains, transform light energy into chemical energy. The first stage of photosynthesis – light-dependent reactions or simply “light reactions” – is complete.

The Calvin Cycle - Advanced


Trace the flow of energy and materials through the Calvin cycle.





Other than being green, what do all these fruits and vegetables have in common?

They are full of energy. Energy in the form of glucose. Fruit and vegetable plants, like all plants, are autotrophs and producers, producing energy from sunlight. The energy from sunlight is briefly held in NADPH and ATP, which is needed to drive the formation of sugars such as glucose. And this all happens in the Calvin Cycle.





Photosynthesis Stage II: The Calvin Cycle - Making Food “From Thin Air”


During the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis, two of the three reactants (water and light) were used to produce oxygen gas, one of the products (and essentially a waste product of this process). All three necessary conditions are required – the chloroplast with chlorophyll pigments, and enzyme catalysts. The first stage transforms light energy into chemical energy, stored to this point in molecules of ATP and NADPH. Look again at the overall equation below. What is left?



Waiting in the atmosphere is one more reactant, carbon dioxide, and yet to come is the product which is food for all life – glucose. These key players perform in the second stage of the photosynthesis, in which food is “made from thin air.” The second stage of photosynthesis can proceed without light, so its steps are sometimes called “light-independent” or “dark” reactions. Many biologists honor the scientist, Melvin Calvin, who won a 1961 Nobel Prize for working out this complex set of chemical reactions, naming it the Calvin Cycle . The Calvin Cycle has two parts. First carbon dioxide is "fixed." Then ATP and NADPH from the Light Reactions provide energy to combine the fixed carbons to make sugar.

The Calvin Cycle is discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slm6D2VEXYs (13:28).

Carbon Dioxide is “Fixed”


Why does carbon dioxide need to be fixed? Was it ever broken? Life on Earth is carbon-based. Organisms need not only energy but also carbon atoms for building bodies. For nearly all life, the ultimate source of carbon is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), an inorganic molecule pulled into the producer from the atmosphere. CO 2 , as you saw in Figure below , makes up .038% of the Earth’s atmosphere.

Animals and most other heterotrophs cannot take in CO 2 directly. They must eat other organisms or absorb organic molecules to get carbon. Only autotrophs can build low-energy inorganic CO 2 into high-energy organic molecules like glucose. This process is carbon fixation .



Figure 6.20

Stomata on the underside of leaves take in CO 2 and release water and O 2 . Guard cells close the stomata when water is scarce. Leaf cross-section (above) and stoma (below).



Plants have evolved three pathways for carbon fixation. The most common pathway combines one molecule of CO 2 with a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). The enzyme which catalyzes this reaction, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (nicknamed RuBisCo ), is the most abundant enzyme on earth! The resulting 6-carbon molecule is unstable, so it immediately splits into two much more stable 3-carbon phosphoglycerate molecules. The 3 carbons in the first stable molecule of this pathway give this largest group of plants the name “C-3.”

Dry air, hot temperatures, and bright sunlight slow the C-3 pathway for carbon fixation. This is because the stomata , tiny openings under the leaf which normally allow CO 2 to enter and O 2 to leave, must close to prevent loss of water vapor ( Figure above ) by transpiration . Closed stomata lead to a shortage of CO 2 . Two alternative pathways for carbon fixation demonstrate biochemical adaptations to differing environments. All three carbon fixation pathways lead to the Calvin Cycle to build sugar.

See CAM Plants at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp6Zj24h8uA (8:37) for further information.

Figure 6.21

Even chemical reactions adapt to specific environments. Carbon fixation pathways vary among three groups. Temperate species (maple tree, left) use the C-3 pathway. C-4 species (corn, center) concentrate CO 2 in a separate compartment to lessen water loss in hot bright climates. Desert plants (jade plant, right) fix CO 2 by CAM photosynthesis only at night, closing stomata in the daytime to conserve water.





C-4 Plants


Plants such as corn solve the problem by using a separate compartment to fix CO 2 . C-4 plants utilize a specific leaf anatomy. These plants have both bundle-sheath cells, which are photosynthetic cells arranged into tightly packed coverings or sheaths around the veins of a leaf, and loosely arranged mesophyll cells, which lie between the bundle sheath cells and the leaf surface. The bundle-sheath cells form a protective covering on leaf veins. The Calvin Cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of these bundle sheath cells in C-4 plants. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin Cycle, CO 2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid, which has the ability to regenerate CO 2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO 2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C-3 pathway.



Figure 6.22

In this diagram of the cross section of a leaf, bundle sheath cells can be seen in pink around a leaf vein, and mesophyll cells can be seen in green surrounding the bundle sheath cells and the outer layers of the leaf. Also noticeable is a cut-away of two guard cells (purple) surrounding a stomata.



In these C-4 plants, fixation of CO 2 occurs in mesophyll cells when it combines with a 3-carbon molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), resulting in a 4-carbon oxaoloacetate molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase. Because the first stable organic molecule has four carbons (oxaoloacetate), this adaptation has the name C-4. This 4-carbon molecule is converted into another 4-carbon molecule, malate, which is shuttled unto the bundle-sheath cells, where it is broken down into CO 2 and a 3-carbon pyruvate. When enough CO 2 accumulates, RuBisCo fixes it a second time, this time as part of the Calvin Cycle. The pyruvate is transported back to the mesophyll cell where it is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate, allowing the process to continue. Compartmentalization allows efficient use of low concentrations of carbon dioxide in these specialized plants.

See C-4 Photosynthesis at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ynX_F-SwNY (16:58) for further information.

CAM Photosynthesis


Cacti and succulents such as the jade plant avoid water loss by fixing CO 2 only at night. These plants close their stomata during the day (by closing their guard cells) and open them only in the cooler and more humid nighttime hours. Leaf structure differs slightly from that of C-4 plants, but the fixation pathways are similar. The family of plants in which this pathway was discovered gives the pathway its name, Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or CAM ( Figure below ). CAM photosynthesis is an adaptation to arid conditions in some plants. CAM photosynthesis is a two-step process: part occurs during the day and part at night.

At night, when the stomata are open, CO 2 can enter the leaf cell, but the light reactions of photosynthesis cannot take place, so ATP and NADPH can't be made. The carbon dioxide is fixed in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells by a PEP reaction similar to that of C-4 pathway, PEP carboxylase combines CO 2 and PEP, making oxalacetate, which is subsequently transformed into malate. But, unlike the C-4 plant, the resulting malate is not immediately passed on to the Calvin Cycle but are stored in vacuoles for later use. The next day, after the sun comes out and the light reactions restart making ATP and NADPH, malate is released from the vacuoles of the mesophyll cells and enters the stroma of the chloroplasts where an enzyme releases the CO 2 , which then enters into the Calvin Cycle.





How Does the Calvin Cycle Store Energy in Sugar?


As Melvin Calvin discovered, carbon fixation is the first step of a cycle. Like an electron transport chain, the Calvin Cycle, shown in Figure below , transfers energy in small, controlled steps. Each step pushes molecules uphill in terms of energy content. Recall that in the electron transfer chain, excited electrons lose energy to NADPH and ATP. In the Calvin Cycle, NADPH and ATP formed in the light reactions lose their stored chemical energy to build glucose.

Use the diagram below to identify the major aspects of the process:

the general cycle pattern

the major reactants

the products





Figure 6.23

Overview of the Calvin Cycle Pathway.



First, notice where carbon is fixed by the enzyme Rubisco. In C-3, C-4, and CAM plants, CO 2 enters the cycle by joining with 5-carbon ribulose bisphosphate to form a 6-carbon intermediate, which splits (so quickly that it isn’t even shown) into two 3-carbon 3-phosphoglycerate molecules. Now look for the points at which ATP and NADPH (made in the light reactions) add chemical energy (“Reduction” in the diagram) to the 3-carbon molecules. The resulting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate “half-sugars” can enter several different metabolic pathways. One recreates the original 5-carbon precursor, completing the cycle. A second combines two of the 3-carbon molecules to form glucose, the universal fuel for life. The cycle begins and ends with the same 5-carbon RuBP molecule, but the process combines carbon and energy to build carbohydrates – food for life.

So – how does photosynthesis store energy in sugar? Six “turns” of the Calvin Cycle use chemical energy from ATP to combine six carbon atoms from six CO 2 molecules with 12 hydrogens from NADPH. The result is one molecule of glucose, C 6 H 12 O 6 .





Vocabulary

Summary


The Calvin Cycle uses the NADPH and ATP from the Light Reactions to “fix” carbon and produce glucose.

Carbon dioxide enters the Calvin Cycle when Rubisco attaches it to a 5-carbon sugar.

Most plants fix CO 2 directly with the Calvin Cycle, so they are called C-3 plants.

Some plants have evolved preliminary fixation pathways, which help them conserve water in hot, dry habitats.

C-4 plants use a 3-carbon carrier to compartmentalize initial carbon fixation in order to concentrate CO 2 before sending it on to Rubisco.

CAM plants open their stomata for preliminary CO 2 fixation only at night.

In the Calvin Cycle, the fixed CO 2 moves through a series of chemical reactions, gaining a small amount of energy from ATP or NADPH at each step.

Six turns of the cycle process 6 molecules of carbon dioxide and 12 hydrogens to produce a single molecule of glucose.

Chemosynthesis - Advanced


Define chemosynthesis and describe chemosynthetic organisms.





Is it possible to live in temperatures over 175°F?

It is if you're a Pompeii worm. The Pompeii worm, the most heat-tolerant animal on Earth, lives in the deep ocean at super-heated hydrothermal vents. Covering this deep-sea worm's back is a fleece of bacteria. These microbes contain all the genes necessary for life in extreme environments.





Chemosynthesis


Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food?

Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn’t the only way that autotrophs produce food. Some bacteria make food by another process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy. This process is called chemosynthesis . In chemosynthesis, one or more carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane, CH 4 ) and nutrients is converted into organic matter, using the oxidation of inorganic molecules, such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) or ammonia (NH 3 ) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight. In hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis, in the presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen, carbohydrates (CH 2 O) can be produced:

CO 2 + O 2 + 4H 2 S → CH 2 O + 4S + 3H 2 O

Many organisms that use chemosynthesis are extremophile members of the kingdom Archaea. These prokaryotes live in harsh conditions such as in the absence of sunlight, and in a wide range of water temperatures, some approaching the boiling point. Some chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as “black smokers.” Compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the vents from Earth’s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make food. Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them include giant tubeworms, like those pictured in Figure below . These organisms are known as chemoautotrophs. Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between these organisms and respiring heterotrophs are quite common.



Figure 6.24

Tubeworms deep in the Galapagos Rift get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria. Tubeworms have no mouth, eyes, or stomach. Their survival depends on a symbiotic relationship with the billions of bacteria that live inside them. These bacteria convert the chemicals that shoot out of the hydrothermal vents into food for the worm.





Vocabulary


chemoautotrophs : Organisms that use the energy stored in chemical compounds to make organic molecules by chemosynthesis.



chemosynthesis : The process by which carbon dioxide molecules are converted to carbohydrates; uses energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.



extremophile : Any organism that thrives in extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, salinity, or concentrations of hostile chemicals; these are characteristics of the Kingdom Archaea.

Cellular Respiration - Advanced


Clarify the relationship between breathing and cellular respiration.





In the presence of oxygen. Why?

Oxygen is made by trees and other plants during photosynthesis. We know that we need oxygen to live. But why? This oxygen is an essential component for the optimal production of usable energy - which occurs through cellular respiration.





Cellular Respiration


You know that humans deprived of oxygen for more than a few minutes will quickly become unconscious and die. Breathing, also known as respiration , is essential for human life, because the body cannot store oxygen for later use as it does food. The mammalian respiratory system, shown in Figure below features a diaphragm, trachea, and a thin membrane whose surface area is equivalent to the size of a handball court - all for efficient oxygen intake. Other forms of life employ different types of respiratory organs: fish and aquatic amphibians and insects flaunt gills, spiders and scorpions develop "book lungs," and terrestrial insects use an elaborate network of tubes called tracheae, which open via spiracles, as shown in Figure below . A constant supply of oxygen gas is clearly important to life. However, do you know why you need oxygen?



Figure 6.25

(left) The human respiratory system is only part of the story of respiration. Diaphragm, lungs, and trachea take air deep into the body and provide oxygen gas to the bloodstream. The fate of that oxygen is the story of cellular respiration. (center) Spiracles in this Cluentius Sphinx ( Neococytius cluentius ) caterpillar connect to a system of internal tubes (tracheae), which carry oxygen throughout the animal's body. (right) Gills in this alpine newt larva, Ichthyosaura alpestris , bring blood close to an extensive surface area so that the newt can absorb dissolved oxygen gas from its watery habitat.



Many people would answer that oxygen is needed to make carbon dioxide, the gas exhaled or released by each of the respiratory systems listed above. However, CO 2 is a waste product. But a waste product of what?

There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.

Though cellular respiration can occur anaerobically without oxygen, the process is much more efficient under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen. And what exactly is the role of oxygen? Oxygen is the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain in the final step of cellular respiration. Oxygen combines with electrons and hydrogen ions to produce water.

Why eat?

Because we're hungry. Not necessarily. Biologically speaking, we eat to get energy. The food we eat is broken down, the glucose extracted, and that energy is converted into ATP. And this happens most efficiently in the presence of oxygen.





An Overview of Cellular Respiration


Another way to think about the role of oxygen in your body - and a good starting point for understanding the whole process of cellular respiration - is to recall (or imagine) the last time you sat by a campfire (see Figure below ) and noticed that it was "dying." Often people will blow on a campfire to keep it from "dying out." How does blowing help? What happens in a campfire?



Figure 6.26

Analyzing what happens when wood burns in a campfire is a good way to begin to understand cellular respiration.



You know that a fire produces light and heat energy. However, it cannot create energy (remember that energy cannot be created or destroyed). Fire merely transforms the energy stored in its fuel – chemical energy – into light and heat. Another way to describe this energy transformation is to say that burning releases the energy stored in fuel. As energy is transformed, so are the compounds that make up the fuel. In other words, burning is a chemical reaction. We could write our understanding of this energy-releasing chemical reaction up to this point as:



Now return to what happens when you blow on a fire. The fire was "dying out," so you blew on it to get it going again. Was it movement or something in the air that promoted the chemical reaction? If you have ever "smothered" a fire, you know that a fire needs something in the air to keep burning. That something turns out to be oxygen. Oxygen gas is a reactant in the burning process. At this point, our equation is:



To complete this equation, we need to know what happens to matter, to the atoms of oxygen, and to the atoms of the fuel during the burning. If you collect the gas rising above a piece of burning wood in an inverted test tube, you will notice condensation - droplets appearing on the sides of the tube. To identify the products , the experiment shown below can be performed. Cobalt chloride paper will change from blue to pink, confirming that these droplets are water. If you add bromothymol blue (BTB) to a second tube of collected gases, the blue solution will change to green or yellow ( Figure below ), indicating the presence of carbon dioxide. Thus, carbon dioxide and water are products of burning wood fuel. The oxygen atoms have been incorporated into carbon dioxide and water.



Figure 6.27

Bromothymol blue (BTB) changes from blue to green to yellow as carbon dioxide is added. Thus, it is a good indicator for this product of burning or cellular respiration.





The oxygen atoms have been incorporated into carbon dioxide and water, but what is the sources of the carbon atoms in the CO 2 and of the hydrogen atoms in the water. These atoms make up the wood fuel – and nearly all fuels we burn, from coal to propane to candle wax to gasoline. Overall, burning is the combining of oxygen with hydrogen and carbon atoms in a fuel (combustion or oxidation) to release the stored chemical energy as heat and light. Products of combustion are CO 2 (oxidized carbon) and H 2 O (oxidized hydrogen). The equation can be modified to:





Cellular Respiration


Recall that breathing rate and oxygen intake is related to energy use. Burning consumes oxygen as it releases stored chemical energy, transforming it into light and heat. Cellular respiration is actually a slow burn. Your cells absorb the oxygen carried by your blood from your lungs, and use the O 2 to release stored chemical energy so that you can use it.





Stages of Cellular Respiration


Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions. As you saw earlier, the reactions can be summed up in this equation:

C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 O + Chemical Energy (in ATP)

The reactions of cellular respiration can be grouped into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle), and electron transport. Figure below gives an overview of these three stages, which are also described below.



Figure 6.28

Cellular respiration takes place in the stages shown here. The process begins with a molecule of glucose, which has six carbon atoms. What happens to each of these atoms of carbon?





ATP


However, releasing energy within cells does not produce light or intense heat. Cells run on chemical energy – specifically, the small amount temporarily stored in ATP molecules. Cellular respiration transfers chemical energy from a "deliverable" fuel molecule – glucose – to many "usable" molecules of ATP. Like oxygen, glucose is delivered by your blood to your cells. If ATP were delivered to cells, more than 60,221,417,930,000,000,000,000,000 of these large molecules (which contain relatively small amounts of energy) would clog your capillaries each day. Pumping them across cell membranes would "cost" a great deal of energy. A molecule of glucose contains a larger amount of chemical energy in a smaller package. Therefore, glucose is much more convenient for bloodstream delivery, but too "powerful" to work within the cell. The process of cellular respiration uses oxygen to help transfer the chemical energy from glucose to ATP, which can be used to do work in the cell. This chemical equation expresses what we have worked out:



As with burning, we must trace what happens to atoms during cellular respiration. You can readily see that when the carbon atoms in glucose are combined with oxygen, they again form carbon dioxide. And when the hydrogen atoms in glucose are oxidized, they form water, as in burning. You can detect these products of cellular respiration in your breath on a cold day (as water condensation) and in the lab (BTB turns yellow when you blow into it through a straw).



This equation accounts for the energy transfer and the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, but it does not show the "raw materials" or reactants which build ATP. Recall that the energy temporarily stored in ATP is released for use when the bond between the second and third phosphates is broken. The resulting ADP can be recycled within the cell by recombining it with inorganic phosphate (P i ).



Figure 6.29

Like recharging batteries, cells recycle ATP and ADP (and AMP) molecules by combining them with inorganic phosphate. When the high-energy bond between phosphate groups in ATP breaks, its chemical energy can do cellular work. The bonds between phosphate groups can be broken and reformed, recycling this cellular energy.



The source of energy for re-attaching the phosphate and making ATP is the chemical energy in glucose. Materials cycle and recycle, but energy gets used up and must be replaced. That is the key to understanding cellular respiration: it is a "recharging of the batteries" - ATP molecules – which power cellular work. How many ATP can be made by harnessing the energy in a single glucose molecule? Although this number varies under certain conditions, most cells can capture enough energy from one molecule of glucose to build 38 molecules of ATP. Our equation becomes:





Mitochondria


This equation for cellular respiration is not quite complete, however, because we can easily mix air and glucose sugar (even adding ADP and P i ) and nothing will happen. For the campfire, we indicated above the arrow that a necessary condition was a spark or match to start the reaction. A spark or match would damage or destroy living tissue. What necessary condition initiates the slow burn that is cellular respiration? Recall that enzymes are highly specific proteins which "speed up" or catalyze chemical reactions in living cells. More than 20 different enzymes are necessary to carry out cellular respiration. Recall also that membranes within organelles often sequence enzymes for efficiency, as in chloroplasts for photosynthesis, you will not be surprised that a specific organelle, the mitochondrion ( Figure below ), is also a necessary condition of cellular respiration - at least in eukaryotes.



Figure 6.30

Mitochondria, shown here as the green ovals in this animal cell, are membranous organelles which sequence enzyme and electron carrier molecules to make cellular respiration highly efficient. Mitochondria have both an inner and outer membrane, with a matrix inside the inner membrane. The inner membrane has many internal folds, increasing the surface area for proteins and molecules involved in cellular respiration.



Within each eukaryotic cell, the membranes of a few to a few thousand mitochondria sequence enzymes and electron carriers and compartmentalize ions so that cellular respiration proceeds efficiently. Mitochondria, like chloroplasts, contain their own DNA and ribosomes and resemble certain bacteria. The Theory of Endosymbiosis holds that mitochondria, like chloroplasts, were once independently living prokaryotes. Larger prokaryotes engulfed (or enslaved) these smaller aerobic cells, forming eukaryotic cells. Many prokaryotes today can perform cellular respiration; perhaps they and mitochondria have common ancestors. Their expertise in generating ATP made mitochondria highly valued symbionts .

Including these necessary conditions and balancing numbers of atoms on both sides of the arrow, our final equation for the overall process of cellular respiration is:



In words, cellular respiration uses oxygen gas to break apart the carbon-hydrogen bonds in glucose and release their energy to build 38 molecules of ATP. Most of this process occurs within the mitochondria of the cell. Carbon dioxide and water are waste products. This is similar to burning, in which oxygen breaks the carbon-hydrogen bonds in a fuel and releases their chemical energy as heat and light. Again, carbon dioxide and water are waste.





Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis


Comparing this process to that of photosynthesis, the similarity between the two processes is striking. Both are processes within the cell which make chemical energy available for life. Photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, and cellular respiration releases the energy from glucose to build ATP, which does the work of life. Moreover, photosynthesis reactants CO 2 and H 2 O are products of cellular respiration. And the reactants of respiration, C 6 H 12 O 6 and O 2 , are the products of photosynthesis. This interdependence is the basis of the carbon-oxygen cycle ( Figure below ), which connects producers to consumers and their environment. At first glance, the cycle merely seems to show mitochondria undoing what chloroplasts do; but the cycle’s energy transformations power all the diversity, beauty, and mystery of life.



Figure 6.31

Photosynthesis in the chloroplast and cellular respiration in the mitochondrion show the interdependence of producers and consumers, the flow of energy from sunlight to heat, and the cycling of carbon and oxygen between living world and environment.

Summary


Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions which transfer energy from glucose (deliverable or fuel energy) to ATP (usable energy).

Analyzing a campfire can clarify your understanding of cellular respiration. A campfire breaks chemical bonds in wood, releasing stored energy as light and heat; respiration breaks chemical bonds in glucose, releasing stored energy and transferring some to 38 ATP; some energy is lost as heat.

This equation summarizes the process of cellular respiration:





In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria organize enzymes and electron carriers and compartmentalize ions so that cellular respiration proceeds efficiently.

Cellular respiration, in many ways the opposite of photosynthesis, shows the interdependence of producers and consumers. Combined, the two equations demonstrate how energy flows and the carbon and oxygen cycle between organisms and environment.

Glycolysis - Advanced


Recognize that glycolysis is the first and most universal of three stages in cellular respiration.

Explain why biologists consider glycolysis to be one of the oldest energy production pathways.

Describe how some of the energy in glucose is transferred to ATP in the cytoplasm, without oxygen.





How do you slice a molecule of glucose in half?

With sharp knives? Not really. But you lyse it with enzymes during a process named glycolysis. Glucose is sliced right in half from a 6-carbon molecule to two 3-carbon molecules. This is the first step and an extremely important part of cellular respiration. It happens all the time, both with and without oxygen. And in the process, transfers some energy to ATP.





Glycolysis: A Universal and Ancient Pathway for Making ATP


When was the last time you enjoyed yogurt on your breakfast cereal, or had a tetanus shot? These experiences may appear unconnected, but both relate to bacteria which do not use oxygen to make ATP. In fact, tetanus bacteria cannot survive if oxygen is present. However, Lactobacillus acidophilus (bacteria which make yogurt) and Clostridium tetani (bacteria which cause tetanus or lockjaw) share with nearly all organisms the first stage of cellular respiration, glycolysis ( Figure below ). Because glycolysis is universal, whereas aerobic (oxygen-requiring) cellular respiration is not, most biologists consider it to be the most fundamental and primitive pathway for making ATP.



Figure 6.32

Clostridium tetani bacteria are obligate anaerobes, which cannot grow in the presence of oxygen and use a variation of glycolysis to make ATP. Because they can grow in deep puncture wounds and secrete a toxin, which can cause muscle spasms, seizures, and death, most people receive tetanus vaccinations at least every ten years throughout life.



Return to the overall equation for cellular respiration:



Like photosynthesis, the process represented by this equation is actually many small, individual chemical reactions. We grouped the reactions of photosynthesis into two stages, the light reactions and the Calvin Cycle. We will divide the reactions of cellular respiration into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle , and the electron transport chain ( Figure below ). In this concept, Stage 1, glycolysis, the oldest and most widespread pathway for making ATP, is discussed. Before diving into the details, we must note that this first stage of cellular respiration is unique among the three stages: it does not require oxygen, and it does not take place in the mitochondrion. The chemical reactions of glycolysis occur without oxygen in the cytosol of the cell ( Figure below ).



Figure 6.33

The many steps in the process of aerobic cellular respiration can be divided into three stages. The first stage, glycolysis, produces ATP without oxygen. Because this part of the cellular respiration pathway is universal, biologists consider it the oldest segment. Note that glycogen and fats can also enter the glycolysis pathway. The second stage is the Krebs Cycle, and the third stage is the electron transport chain. It is during the third stage that chemiosmosis produces numerous ATP molecules.





Figure 6.34

Glycolysis, unlike the latter two stages of cellular respiration, takes place without oxygen in the cytosol (blue) of the cell. For many organisms, aerobic respiration continues with the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain in the mitochondria (green). To enter the mitochondria, glucose must first be lysed into smaller molecules.



The name for Stage 1 clearly indicates what happens during that stage: glyco - refers to glucose, and - lysis means "splitting." In glycolysis, within the cytosol of the cell, a minimum of eight different enzymes break apart glucose into two 3-carbon molecules. The energy released in breaking those bonds is transferred to carrier molecules, ATP and NADH. NADH temporarily holds small amounts of energy which can be used later to build ATP. The 3-carbon product of glycolysis is pyruvate , or pyruvic acid ( Figure below ). (The difference between them is actually a sole hydrogen atom. Pyruvic acid: CH 3 COCOOH, pyruvate: CH 3 COCOO - .) Overall, glycolysis can be represented as:

C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2NAD + + 2P i + 2ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP



Figure 6.35

In glycolysis, glucose (C6) is split into two 3-carbon (C3) pyruvate molecules. This releases energy, which is transferred to ATP. How many ATP molecules are made during this stage of cellular respiration?





Figure 6.36

Glycolysis breaks the 6-carbon molecule glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules, releasing some of the chemical energy which had been stored in glucose.



However, even this equation is deceiving. Just the splitting of glucose requires many steps, each transferring or capturing small amounts of energy. Individual steps appear in Figure below . Studying the pathway in detail reveals that cells must "spend" or "invest" two ATP in order to begin the process of breaking glucose apart. Note that the phosphates produced by breaking apart ATP join with glucose, making it unstable and more likely to break apart. Later steps harness the energy released when glucose splits, and use it to build "hot hydrogens" (NAD + is reduced to NADH) and ATP (ADP + P i → ATP). If you count the ATP produced, you will find a net yield of two ATP per glucose (4 produced – 2 spent). Remember to double the second set of reactions to account for the two 3-carbon molecules which follow that pathway! The "hot hydrogens" can power other metabolic pathways, or in many organisms, provide energy for further ATP synthesis.



To summarize: In the cytosol of the cell, glycolysis transfers some of the chemical energy stored in one molecule of glucose to two molecules of ATP and two NADH. This makes (some of) the energy in glucose, a universal fuel molecule for cells, available to use in cellular work - moving organelles, transporting molecules across membranes, or building large organic molecules.

Although glycolysis is universal, pathways leading away from glycolysis vary among species depending on the availability of oxygen. If oxygen is unavailable, pyruvate may be converted to lactic acid or ethanol and carbon dioxide in order to regenerate NAD + , ending anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is also called fermentation , which will be discussed in another concept.

If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for further breakdown, releasing far more energy and producing many additional molecules of ATP in the latter two stages of aerobic respiration - the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. We will explore these, too, in a later section.

The Mitochondria in Cellular Respiration - Advanced


Describe the structure of the mitochondrion, and identify the site of Krebs Cycle reactions.





Why does this organelle have such a distinct internal structure?

It is the many internal folds of the inner membrane that allow mitochondria to be efficient at producing ATP. And in the presence of oxygen, the organelle is highly efficient. Even though, cells that needs lots of energy may have thousands of these organelles.





Structure of the Mitochondrion: Key to Aerobic Respiration


The aerobic phases of cellular respiration in eukaryotes occur within organelles called mitochondria . These aerobic phases are the Krebs Cycle and the electron transport chain . A detailed look at the structure of the mitochondrion ( Figure below ) helps to explain its role in the last stage of respiration, the electron transport chain. Mitochondria are sometimes referred to as the "power plants" of the cell, as these are the organelles that generate most of the cell's supply of ATP.

Two separate membranes form the mitochondrion. The inner membrane folds into cristae which divide the organelle into three compartments: the intermembrane space (between outer and inner membranes), cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and the matrix (within the inner membrane). The Krebs Cycle takes place within the matrix. The compartments are critical for the electron transport chain structure and function. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, with the products of glycolysis entering the mitochondria to continue cellular respiration.



Figure 6.37

Mitochondria, organelles specialized to carry out aerobic respiration, contain an inner membrane folded into cristae, which form two separate compartments: the inner membrane space and the matrix. The Krebs Cycle takes place in the matrix. The electron transport chain is embedded in the inner membrane and uses both compartments to make ATP by chemiosmosis . Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes, resembling those of prokaryotic organisms.





Mitochondrial Compartments


The double membrane nature of the mitochondria results in five distinct compartments, each with an important role in cellular respiration. These compartments are:

the outer mitochondrial membrane,

the intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes),

the inner mitochondrial membrane,

the cristae (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and

the matrix (space within the inner membrane).



The roles of these compartments in cellular respiration include:

the outer mitochondrial membrane: allows for the establishment of the inter membrane space,

the intermembrane space: holds protons that are pumped out of the matrix during electron transport,

the inner mitochondrial membrane: organizes the electron transport chain and holds ATP synthase ,

the cristae: expand the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane, enhancing its ability to produce ATP, and

the matrix: site of ATP synthesis and the location of the Krebs cycle.





Vocabulary


ATP synthase : Ion channel and enzyme complex; chemically bonds a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP as H + ions flow through the ion channel.



chemiosmosis : Process in cellular respiration or photosynthesis which produces ATP; uses the energy of hydrogen ions diffusing through ATP synthase.



cristae : Inner membrane folds of the mitochondrion.



electron transport chain : Series of electron-transport molecules that pass high-energy electrons from molecule to molecule and capture their energy.



Krebs cycle : Stage 2 of aerobic cellular respiration; a series of chemical reactions which completes the breakdown of glucose begun in stage 1, releasing more chemical energy and producing carbon dioxide; also called the Citric Acid Cycle.



matrix : Fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrion; space inside of the inner membrane.



mitochondria : (singular, mitochondrion ): Membrane-enclosed organelles that are found in most eukaryotic cells; called the "power plants" of the cell because they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP.

What type of acid do these fruits contain?

Citric acid. Citric acid is also the first product formed in the Krebs cycle, and therefore this acid occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things.





Aerobic Respiration


Enticing clues - volcanic gases, vast iron ore sediments, and bubbles of ancient air trapped in amber – suggest dramatic changes during the history of earth’s atmosphere. Correlating these clues with the fossil record leads to two major conclusions: that early life evolved in the absence of oxygen, and that oxygen first appeared between 2 and 3 billion years ago ( Figure below ) because of photosynthesis by the blue green bacteria, cyanobacteria. The chemistry of cellular respiration reflects this history. Its first stage, glycolysis , is universal and does not use oxygen.



Figure 6.38

Oxygen has increased in the atmosphere throughout the history of the earth. Note the logarithmic scale, which indicates great increases after first photosynthesis (in bacteria) and then land plants evolved. Related geological events: A = no oxidized iron; B = oxidized iron bands in seabed rock - evidence for O 2 in the oceans; C = oxidized iron bands on land and ozone layer formation- evidence for O 2 in the atmosphere.



Absolutely dependent on oxygen gas, we find it difficult to imagine that its appearance must have been disastrous for the anaerobic organisms that evolved in its absence. But oxygen is highly reactive, and at first, its effect on evolution was so negative that some have named this period the “oxygen catastrophe.” However, as oxygen gradually formed a protective ozone layer , life rebounded. After the first organisms evolved to use oxygen to their advantage, the diversity of aerobic organisms exploded. According to the Theory of Endosymbiosis , engulfing of some of these aerobic bacteria led to eukaryotic cells with mitochondria, and multicellularity , the evolution of multicellular eukaryotic organisms, followed. Today, we live in an atmosphere which is 21% oxygen, and most of life follows glycolysis with the last two, aerobic stages of cellular respiration.

Recall the purpose of cellular respiration: to release energy from glucose to make ATP, the universal molecule of energy for cellular work. The following equation describes the overall process, although it summarizes many individual chemical reactions.



Once again, the first stage of this process, glycolysis, is ancient, universal, and anaerobic. In the cytoplasm of most cells, glycolysis breaks each 6-carbon molecule of glucose into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate . Chemical energy, which had been stored in the now broken bonds, is transferred to 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules.

The fate of pyruvate depends on the species and the presence or absence of oxygen. If oxygen is present to drive subsequent reactions, pruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the Krebs Cycle (Stage 2) and electron transport chain (Stage 3) break it down and oxidize it completely to CO 2 and H 2 O. The energy released builds many more ATP molecules, though of course some is lost as heat. Let’s explore the details of how mitochondria use oxygen to make more ATP from glucose by aerobic respiration.





The Krebs Cycle: Capturing Energy from Pyruvate


Aerobic respiration begins with the entry of the product of glycolysis, pyruvate, into the mitochondria. For each initial glucose molecules, two pyruvate molecules will enter the mitochondria. Pyruvate, however, is not the molecule that enters the Krebs cycle. Prior to entry into this cycle, pyruvate must be converted into a 2-carbon acetyl-CoenzymeA (acetyl-CoA) unit. The conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA is referred to as the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. It is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This process produces one NADH electron carrier while releasing a CO 2 molecule. This step is also known as the link reaction or transition step, as it links glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Of course, as two pyruvates result from glycolysis, two acetyl-CoAs are produced as are 2 NADH molecules.



Figure 6.39

After glycolysis, two 3-carbon pyruvates enter the mitochondrion, where they are converted to two 2-carbon acetyl-CoenzymeA (CoA) molecules. Acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs Cycle. Note that the carbons removed become carbon dioxide, accounting for two of the six such end products of glucose oxidation. The energy released by this breakdown is carried by NADH.





Figure 6.40

The Krebs cycle completes the breakdown of glucose begun in glycolysis. If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted to AcetylCoA. AcetylCoA enters the cycle by combining with 4-carbon oxaloacetate. Study the diagram to confirm that each turn of the cycle (two for each glucose) stores energy in 3 NADH+H + , one FADH 2 , and one ATP (from GTP), and releases 2 CO 2 . The Krebs cycle is also known as the Citric Acid Cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle).



Within the mitochondria, each pyruvate is broken apart and combined with a coenzyme known as CoA to form a 2-carbon molecule, Acetyl-CoA, which can enter the Krebs Cycle. A single atom of carbon (per pyruvate) is “lost” as carbon dioxide. The energy released in this breakdown is captured in two NADH molecules. See Figure above . Fatty acids can also break down into Acetyl-CoA. By this means, lipids, like fats, can be “burned” to make ATP using the Krebs Cycle.

The Krebs Cycle ( Figure above ) begins by combining each Acetyl-CoA with a four-carbon carrier molecule to make a 6-carbon molecule of citric acid (or citrate, its ionized form). For this reason, the Krebs Cycle, named for a scientist who worked out its details, is also called the Citric Acid Cycle .

The cycle carries citric acid through a series of chemical reactions which gradually release energy and capture it in several carrier molecules. For each Acetyl-CoA which enters the cycle, 3 NAD + are reduced to NADH, one molecule of FAD (another temporary energy carrier) is reduced to FADH 2 , and one molecule of ATP (actually a precursor, GTP, guanine triphosphate) is produced. Study Figure above to locate each of these energy-capturing events.

Note what happens to carbon atoms (black dots in Figure above ). For each 2-carbon Acetyl-CoA which enters the cycle, two molecules of carbon dioxide are released, completing the breakdown of the original 6-carbon glucose molecule. The final step regenerates the original 4-carbon molecule which began the cycle, so that another Acetyl-CoA can enter the cycle.



In summary, the Krebs Cycle completes the breakdown of glucose which began with glycolysis. Its chemical reactions oxidize all six of the original carbon atoms to CO 2 , and capture the energy released in 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2 FADH 2 . These energy carriers join the 2 ATP and 2 NADH produced in glycolysis and the 2 NADH produced in the conversion of 2 pyruvates to 2 Acetyl-CoA molecules.

At the conclusion of the Krebs Cycle, glucose is completely broken down, yet only four ATP have been produced. Moreover, although oxygen is required to drive the Krebs Cycle, the cycle’s chemical reactions do not themselves consume O 2 . The conclusion of cellular respiration, stage 3, produces the majority of the ATP.

Summary


Oxygen produced by the first photosynthetic organisms was probably toxic to early anaerobic life forms, but later organisms evolved a way to harness the power of oxygen to make ATP.

In eukaryotic cells, if oxygen is present, the pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis in the cytoplasm enter the mitochondria for further breakdown and energy release. The Krebs Cycle harnesses the energy which remains in pyruvate after glycolysis.

The Krebs Cycle removes energy from citric acid in small steps, storing it in diverse energy carrier molecules: ATP, NADH and FADH 2 .

The Krebs Cycle produces two molecules of CO 2 per Acetyl-CoA, completing the breakdown of glucose.

Identify the role of oxygen in making stored chemical-bond energy available to cells.





Train, truck, boat or plane?

What do these have in common? They are ways to transport. And they all use a lot of energy. To make ATP, energy must be "transported" - first from glucose to NADH, and then somehow passed to ATP. How is this done? With an electron transport chain, the third stage of aerobic respiration. This third stage uses energy to make energy.





The Electron Transport Chain: ATP for Life in the Fast Lane


At the end of the Krebs Cycle, energy from the chemical bonds of glucose is stored in diverse energy carrier molecules: four ATPs, but also two FADH 2 and ten NADH molecules. The primary task of the last stage of cellular respiration, the electron transport chain , is to transfer energy from the electron carriers to even more ATP molecules, the “batteries” which power work within the cell.

Pathways for making ATP in stage 3 of aerobic respiration closely resemble the electron transport chains used in photosynthesis. In both electron transport chains, energy carrier molecules are arranged in sequence within a membrane so that energy-carrying electrons cascade from one to another, losing a little energy in each step. In both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, the energy lost is harnessed to pump hydrogen ions into a compartment, creating an electrochemical gradient or chemiosmotic gradient across the enclosing membrane. And in both processes, the energy stored in the chemiosmotic gradient is used with ATP synthase to build ATP.

For aerobic respiration, the electron transport chain or “respiratory chain” is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria ( Figure below ). The FADH 2 and NADH molecules produced in glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle, donate high-energy electrons to energy carrier molecules within the membrane. As they pass from one carrier to another, the energy they lose is used to pump hydrogen ions into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. Hydrogen ions flow “down” the gradient – from outer to inner compartment – through the ion channel/enzyme ATP synthase, which transfers their energy to ATP. Note the paradox that it requires energy to create and maintain a concentration gradient of hydrogen ions that are then used by ATP synthase to create stored energy (ATP). In broad terms, it takes energy to make energy. Coupling the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis with a hydrogen ion gradient is chemiosmosis , first described by Nobel laureate Peter D. Mitchell. This process, the use of energy to phosphorylate ADP and produce ATP is also known as oxidative phosphorylation.



Figure 6.41

The third stage of cellular respiration uses the energy stored during the earlier stages in NADH and FADH 2 to make ATP. Electron transport chains embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane capture high-energy electrons from the carrier molecules and use them to concentrate hydrogen ions in the intermembrane space. Hydrogen ions flow down their electrochemical gradient back into the matrix through ATP synthase channels which capture their energy to convert ADP to ATP. Notice that the process regenerated NAD + , supplying the electron acceptor molecule needed in glycolysis.



After passing through the electron transport chain, low-energy electrons and low-energy hydrogen ions combine with oxygen to form water. Thus, oxygen’s role is to drive the entire set of ATP-producing reactions within the mitochondrion by accepting “spent” hydrogens. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor; no part of the process - from the Krebs Cycle through electron transport chain – can happen without oxygen.

The electron transport chain can convert the energy from one glucose molecule’s worth of FADH 2 and NADH + H + into as many as 34 ATP. When the four ATP produced in glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle are added, the total 0f 38 ATP fits the overall equation for aerobic cellular respiration:



A summary of the electron transport chain can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfgCcFXUZRk (17:16).

Aerobic respiration is complete. If oxygen is available, cellular respiration transfers the energy from one molecule of glucose to 38 molecules of ATP, releasing carbon dioxide and water as waste. “Deliverable” food energy has become energy which can be used for work within the cell – transport within the cell, pumping ions and molecules across membranes, and building large organic molecules. Can you see how this could lead to “life in the fast lane” compared to anaerobic respiration (glycolysis alone)?

Why does a bakery smell so good?

When bread bakes, yeast releases carbon dioxide gas, forming the small holes in bread. The gas was produced by alcoholic fermentation carried out by yeast.





Anaerobic Respiration


After the photosynthetic “oxygen catastrophe” challenged life between 2.5 and 3 billion years ago, evolution rebounded with biochemical pathways to harness and protect against oxygen’s power. Today, most organisms use O 2 in aerobic respiration to produce ATP. Almost all animals, most fungi, and some bacteria are obligate aerobes , which require oxygen. Some plants and fungi and many bacteria retain the ability to make ATP without oxygen. Recall that O 2 is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration. Oxygen is required for oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. But in the absence of O 2 . ATP must still be made.

The facultative anaerobes use ancient anaerobic pathways when oxygen is limited. A few bacteria remain as obligate anaerobes , which die in the presence of oxygen and depend on only the first (anaerobic) stage of cellular respiration. Aerobic and anaerobic pathways diverge after glycolysis splits glucose into two molecules of pyruvate:

C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2NAD + + 2P i + 2ADP → 2NADH + 2ATP



Figure 6.42

Anaerobic and aerobic respiration share the glycolysis pathway. If oxygen is not present, fermentation may take place, producing lactic acid or ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. Products of fermentation still contain chemical energy and are used widely to make foods and fuels.



Pyruvate still contains a great deal of chemical energy. In fact, two pyruvate molecules contain most of the chemical energy from the original glucose molecule. If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for complete breakdown by the Krebs Cycle and electron transport chain. If oxygen is not present, cells must transform pyruvate to regenerate NAD + in order to continue making ATP. Keep in mind that glycolysis produces a net total of 2 ATP.

Two different pathways accomplish the regeneration of NAD + with rather famous products: lactic acid (C 3 H 6 O 3 ) and ethyl alcohol (C 2 H 6 O) ( Figure above ). Making ATP in the absence of oxygen by glycolysis alone is known as fermentation . Therefore, these two pathways are called lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation . If you lack interest in organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, which have “stuck with” the anaerobic tradition, the products of these chemical reactions may still intrigue you. Fermentation makes bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and some new biofuels. In addition, some of your body’s cells are facultative anaerobes, retaining one of these ancient pathways for short-term, emergency use.

Obligate aerobes require oxygen to make ATP. Facultative anaerobes make ATP with oxygen, but if oxygen levels become low, they can use fermentation.

Lactic Acid Fermentation - Advanced


Describe lactic acid fermentation.

Describe how bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt, make ATP in the absence of oxygen.

Discuss how your muscles continue to work for you even when your respiratory and cardiovascular system can no longer keep up a continuous supply of oxygen.





Is there enough ATP?

Yes. But not to keep this effort up for a long time. Short spurts of sprinting are sustained by fermentation in muscle cells. This produces just enough ATP to allow these short bursts of increased activity.





Lactic Acid Fermentation: Muscle Cells and Yogurt


For chicken or turkey dinners, do you prefer light meat or dark? Do you consider yourself a sprinter or a long distance runner? What is the biological difference between light meat or dark meat? Or between the two types of runners? Would you believe it has something to do with muscle color?



Figure 6.43

Light meat or dark? Sprinting or endurance? Muscle cells know two ways of making ATP – aerobic and anaerobic respiration.





Are Drumsticks and Athletic Prowess Related?


Muscle color reflects its specialization for aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. Although humans are obligate aerobes , our muscle cells have not given up on ancient pathways which allow them to keep producing ATP quickly when oxygen runs low. The difference is more pronounced in chickens and grouse ( Figure below ), which stand around all day on their legs. For long periods of time, they carry out aerobic respiration in their “specialized-for-endurance” red muscles. If you are familiar with grouse, you know that these birds “flush” with great speed over short distances. Such “sprinting” flight depends on anaerobic respiration in the white cells of breast and wing muscle, allowing rapid production of ATP in low oxygen situations.

No human muscle is all red or all white, but chances are, if you excel at sprinting short distances or at a sport such as weight lifting, you have more white glycolytic fibers in your leg muscles, allowing anaerobic respiration. If you run marathons, you probably have more red oxidative fibers, performing aerobic respiration.



Figure 6.44

Ruffed grouse use anaerobic respiration (lactic acid fermentation) in wing and breast muscles for quick bursts of speed to escape from predators.





Lactic Acid Fermentation


You may have not been aware that your muscle cells can ferment. Fermentation is the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen, through glycolysis alone. Recall that glycolysis breaks a glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, producing a net gain of two ATP and two NADH molecules. Lactic acid fermentation is the type of anaerobic respiration carried out by yogurt bacteria ( Lactobacillus and others) and by your own muscle cells when you work them hard and fast.

Lactic acid fermentation converts the 3-carbon pyruvate to the 3-carbon lactic acid (C 3 H 6 O 3 ) (see Figure below ) and regenerates NAD + in the process, allowing glycolysis to continue to make ATP in low-oxygen conditions. Since there is a limited supply of NAD + available in any given cell, this electron acceptor must be regenerated to allow ATP production to continue. To achieve this, NADH donates its extra electrons to the pyruvate molecules, regenerating NAD + . Lactic acid is formed by the reduction of pyruvate.



Figure 6.45

Lactic acid, C 3 H 6 O 3 .



Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactic acid, and regenerates NAD + from NADH:

C 3 H 3 O 3 (pyruvate) + NADH → C 3 H 6 O 3 (lactic acid) + NAD +



Figure 6.46

Lactic acid fermentation makes ATP in the absence of oxygen by converting glucose to lactic acid (through a pyruvate intermediate). Making lactic acid from pyruvate oxidizes NADH, regenerating NAD + so that glycolysis can continue to make more ATP rapidly. Each circle represents a carbon atom.



For Lactobacillus bacteria, the acid resulting from fermentation kills bacterial competitors in buttermilk, yogurt, and some cottage cheese. The benefits extend to humans who enjoy these foods, as well ( Figure below ).



Figure 6.47

Lactobacillus bacteria use the same type of anaerobic respiration as our muscle cells. Lactic acid reduces competition from other bacteria and flavors yogurt.



You may have noticed this type of fermentation in your own muscles, because muscle fatigue and pain are associated with lactic acid. Lactic acid accumulates in your muscle cells as fermentation proceeds during times of strenuous exercise. During these times, your respiratory and cardiovascular system cannot transport oxygen to your muscle cells, especially those in your legs, fast enough to maintain aerobic respiration. To allow the continuous production of some ATP, your muscle cells use lactic acid fermentation.





Vocabulary


fermentation : Type of anaerobic respiration that includes glycolysis followed by the conversion of pyruvic acid to one or more other compounds and the formation of NAD + ; the process of producing ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis.



lactic acid fermentation : The process for making ATP in the absence of oxygen by converting glucose to lactic acid.



obligate aerobe : An organism which requires oxygen for cellular respiration.





Summary


Some bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt, make ATP using lactic acid fermentation.

Muscle cells can continue to produce ATP when oxygen runs low using lactic acid fermentation, but muscle fatigue and pain may result.

Alcoholic Fermentation - Advanced


Describe alcoholic fermentation.

Outline the process used to produce fuel from corn.

Explain how we employ anaerobic organisms to make bread, beer, and wine.





When you combine grapes and yeast, what have you begun to make?

Wine. It may be slightly more complicated than that, but you need to start with grapes and yeast, and allow a natural fermentation process to occur. Essentially, this is respiration without oxygen.





Alcoholic Fermentation: A “New” Source of Energy?


Have you fueled your car with corn? You have, if you bought gas within the city of Portland, Oregon. Portland was the first city to require that all gasoline sold within the city limits contain at least 10% ethanol. By mid-2006, nearly 6 million “flex-fuel” vehicles – which can use gasoline blends up to 85% ethanol (E85 – Figure below ) were traveling US roads. This “new” industry employs an “old” crew of yeast and bacteria to make ethanol by an even older biochemical pathway – alcoholic fermentation . Alcoholic fermentation is a biochemical process in which sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose are converted into small amounts of ATP, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide during the process.



Figure 6.48

Ethanol provides up to 85% of the energy needs of new “flex-fuel” cars. Although its energy efficiency is still controversial, ethanol from corn or cellulose appears to be more “renewable” than fossil fuels.



Many people consider renewable biofuels such as ethanol a partial solution to the declining availability of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Although controversy still surrounds the true efficiency of producing fuel from corn, ethanol is creeping into the world fuel resource picture ( Figure below ).



Figure 6.49

One of the newest kids on the block, ethanol from corn or cellulose is produced by yeasts through alcoholic fermentation – an anaerobic type of respiration.



You are probably most familiar with the term fermentation in terms of alcoholic beverages. You may not have considered that the process is actually a chemical reaction certain bacteria and yeasts use to make ATP. Like lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation, which is also referred to ethanol fermentation , processes pyruvate one step further in order to regenerate NAD + so that glycolysis can continue to make ATP, even in low oxygen environments. In this form of anaerobic respiration, pyruvate is broken down into ethyl alcohol (C 2 H 6 O) and carbon dioxide.

C 3 H 3 O 3 (pyruvate) + NADH → C 2 H 5 OH (ethyl alcohol) + CO 2 + NAD +



Figure 6.50

Alcoholic fermentation produces ethanol and NAD + . The NAD + allows glycolysis to continue making ATP.





Fermentation by Yeast


We have domesticated yeast ( Figure below and Figure below ) to carry out this type of anaerobic respiration for many commercial purposes. Some yeasts, such as the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, actually prefer fermentation over aerobic respiration. These yeasts will produce ethanol even under aerobic conditions. When you make bread, you employ the yeast to make the bread “rise” by producing bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. Ethanol is also produced. Why do you suppose that eating bread does not intoxicate you?

Bread is not intoxicating because the bread fermentation process takes a short amount of time, only allowing for a small amount of alcohol to be produced, most of which will evaporate during the baking process. A study was reported to the American Chemical Society suggesting that after collecting samples from bakeries and housewive's ovens, they found that the alcohol content varied from 0.04% to 1.9%. The alcohol content of bread varies with the kind of yeast used, the time it sets, and the temperature of baking. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1709087/?page=1



Figure 6.51

Yeasts (A) are facultative anaerobes, which means that in the absence of oxygen, they use alcoholic fermentation to produce ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. Both products are important commercially. Recall that yeasts are single-celled eukaryotic organisms that reproduce asexually (B).





Figure 6.52

We employ yeasts to use their anaerobic talents to help bread rise (via bubbles of CO 2 ) and grapes ferment (adding ethanol).



Brewers of beer and wine use yeast to add alcohol to beverages. Traditional varieties of yeast not only make but also limit the quantity of alcohol in these beverages, because above 18% by volume, alcohol becomes toxic to the yeast itself. Wine is produced by fermentation of the natural sugars present in grapes and other kinds of fruit. Beer, whiskey, and vodka are produced by fermentation of grain starches that have been converted to sugar by the enzyme amylase, and rum is produced by fermentation of sugarcane. In each of these fermentations, sugars are converted into small amounts of ATP, using and regenerating NAD + in the process, and producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. Scientists have recently developed new strains of yeast which can tolerate up to 25% alcohol by volume. These are used primarily in the production of ethanol fuel.

Human use of alcoholic fermentation depends on the chemical energy remaining in pyruvate after glycolysis. Transforming pyruvate does not add ATP to that produced in glycolysis, and for anaerobic organisms, this is the end of the ATP-producing line. All types of anaerobic respiration yield only 2 ATP per glucose.

Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration - Advanced


Compare the energy efficiency of aerobic cellular respiration to that of fermentation.

List the advantages of anaerobic over aerobic respiration.

Explain why vertebrate muscles use both aerobic and anaerobic pathways to make ATP.





Why oxygen?

Anaerobic vs. aerobic. Which is more efficient? It does depend on oxygen. Why do ALL your cells need oxygen? Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, only a few ATP are produced from glucose. In the presence of oxygen, many more ATP are made.





Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration: A Comparison


As aerobes in a world of aerobic organisms, we tend to consider aerobic respiration “better” than fermentation . In some ways, it is. However, anaerobic respiration has persisted far longer on this planet, through major changes in atmosphere and life. There must be value in this alternative way of making ATP.



Figure 6.53

E. coli bacteria are anaerobic bacteria that live in the human digestive tract.



A major argument in favor of aerobic over anaerobic respiration is overall energy production. Without oxygen, organisms can only break a 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. As we saw earlier, glycolysis releases only enough energy to produce two (net) ATPs per molecule of glucose. In anaerobic respiration, this is where ATP production stops. There is a final total of only two ATPs produced per molecule of glucose. This anaerobic process does occur very quickly though. For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need for short bursts of intense activity.



Figure 6.54

The muscles of these hurdlers need to use anaerobic respiration for energy. It gives them the energy they need for the short-term, intense activity of this sport.



Aerobic respiration, on the other hand, produces ATP more slowly. It does, however, break glucose all the way down to CO 2 , producing up to 38 ATPs. Membrane transport (active transport) costs can slightly reduce this theoretical yield, but aerobic respiration consistently produces at least 15 times as much ATP as anaerobic respiration. This vast increase in energy production probably explains why aerobic organisms have come to dominate life on earth. It may also explain how organisms were able to increase in size, adding multicellularity and great diversity.

However, anaerobic pathways do persist, and obligate anaerobes have survived over 2 billion years beyond the evolution of aerobic respiration. So there must be advantages to fermentation. What are these advantages?

One advantage is available to organisms occupying the few anoxic (lacking oxygen) niches remaining on earth. Oxygen remains the highly reactive, toxic gas which caused the “Oxygen Catastrophe.” Aerobic organisms have evolved a few necessary materials, namely enzymes and antioxidants , to protect themselves. Organisms living in anoxic niches do not run the risk of oxygen exposure, so they do not need to spend energy to build these elaborate chemicals.

Individual cells which experience anoxic conditions face greater challenges. As demonstrated by lactic acid fermentation , muscle cells “still remember” anaerobic respiration, using this fermentation to make ATP in low-oxygen conditions, regenerating NAD + during this process. However, other cells, like brain cells do not “remember” anaerobic respiration, and consequently cannot make any ATP without oxygen. This explains why death follows for most humans who endure more than four minutes without oxygen.

Variation in muscle cells gives further insight into some benefits of anaerobic respiration. In vertebrate muscles, lactic acid fermentation allows muscles to produce ATP quickly during short bursts of strenuous activity. Muscle cells specialized for this type of activity show differences in structure as well as chemistry. Red muscle fibers are “dark” because they have a rich blood supply for a steady supply of oxygen, and a protein, myoglobin, which holds extra oxygen. They also contain more mitochondria, the organelle in which the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain conclude aerobic respiration. This is endurance muscle. White muscle cells are “light” because they lack the rich blood supply, have fewer mitochondria, and store the carbohydrate glycogen rather than oxygen. This is muscle built for sprinting.

Each type of muscle fiber has advantages and disadvantages, which reflect their differing biochemical pathways. Aerobic respiration in red muscles full of mitochondria, produces a great deal of ATP from far less glucose - but slowly, over a long time. Anaerobic respiration in white muscle cells full of carbohydrates, produces ATP rapidly for quick bursts of speed, but a predator who continues pursuit may eventually catch a white-muscled prey.





Summary


In summary, aerobic and anaerobic respiration each have advantages under specific conditions. Aerobic respiration produces far more ATP, but risks exposure to oxygen toxicity. Anaerobic respiration is less energy-efficient, but allows survival in habitats which lack oxygen. Within the human body, both are important to muscle function. Muscle cells specialized for aerobic respiration provide endurance, and those specialized for lactic acid fermentation support short but intense energy expenditures. Both ways of making ATP play critical roles in life on earth.

Summary


Aerobic respiration is far more energy-efficient than anaerobic respiration.

Cell Division - Advanced


Introduction




What do you think this colorful picture shows? If you guessed that it’s a picture of a cell undergoing cell division, you are right. In fact, the picture is an image of a lung cell stained with fluorescent dyes undergoing mitosis, specifically during early anaphase. You will read about mitosis, a type of cell division, in these concepts. The separating chromosomes and the spindles are visible in this photo.

Cell division is just one of the stages that all cells go through during their life. This includes cells that are harmful, such as cancer cells. Cancer cells divide more often than normal cells, and grow out of control. In fact, this is how cancer cells cause illness. In these concepts, you will read about how cells divide, what other stages cells go through, and what causes cancer cells to divide out of control and harm the body.





Cell Division - Advanced


Define cell division.





Where do cells come from?

No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division. This is one of the core concepts of the Cell Theory. The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell. The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions. But whatever type of cell it is, it comes from a preexisting cell. And the new cell is genetically identical to its parent cell - that is, it has exactly the same DNA.





Cell Division


A cell is the simplest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. From the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, all life is made of at least one cell.

You are made of trillions of cells. Cells of many different types of cells. Nerve cells, skin cells, muscle cells, blood cells and many more. These cells obviously have many different functions, yet they all develop from the first cell that makes you, the zygote. So do they all have the same DNA? Of course they do. Are all the cells in your body genetically identical? Of course they are. How does the first cell of an organism know to become two cells, then four cells, and so on? What tells these cells what to do? The answers to those questions are more complicated than a simple yes or no.

Your body produces about 25 million genetically identical cells every second. These new cells are formed when older cells divide, a process called cell division or cell reproduction. Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells, as seen in the Figure below .

Eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells complete this division process by a number of different mechanisms. In eukaryotic cells, cell division is the final step in the life of a cell, otherwise known as the cell cycle . The cell cycle is a repeating series of events, during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions, including metabolism, cellular growth, and division, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. To produce two genetically identical daughter cells, the chromosomes need to replicate, a process called DNA replication, and the nucleus and cytoplasm need to divide, two processes termed mitosis and cytokinesis , respectively. These are key events in the life of a cell.



Figure 7.1

This image depicts an animal cell in the final stages of cell division. Essentially, the cell grows in size, the nucleus divides (mitosis), and then the cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis), forming new plasma membrane between the two genetically identical daughter cells.



Corresponding cell division in prokaryotes is known as binary fission . In binary fission, the cell divides, but of course, there is no nucleus, so mitosis does not occur. The DNA must still replicate prior to division. For single-celled organisms, which includes all bacteria and single-celled eukaryotes, cell division is how that organism reproduces, creating an entirely new organism.

In another type of eukaryotic cell division called meiosis , a cell is permanently transformed into a haploid gamete, with half as much DNA as the parent cell, and may not divide again until fertilization.

An introductory animation of cell division and the cell cycle can be viewed at http://vimeo.com/9536315 .

Prokaryotic Cell Division - Advanced


Describe the properties of cell division in prokaryotes.





How do bacteria reproduce?

Essentially, after replicating their DNA, they just grow and divide. As shown here, they grow larger and then split into two separate but genetically identical cells.





Cell Division in Prokaryotes


Prokaryotic organisms reproduce asexually by binary fission , a process that produces identical offspring ( Figure below ). In asexual reproduction , a single parent produces genetically identical offspring. As prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, and have only one circular chromosome, they do not need to reproduce by the same mechanism as eukaryotic cells; mitosis does not exist in prokaryotic cells . Prokaryotic cell division is a much simpler process. In prokaryotic cell division, after the single chromosome is copied, the cell grows larger. Eventually the two chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends of the cell. Newly formed cell membrane then grows into the center of the cell, separating the two chromosomes, and forming two genetically identical daughter cells. Some eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, also divide by binary fission.

Binary fission can be described as a series of steps, although it is actually a continuous process. The steps are described below and also illustrated in Figure below . They include DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and finally the separation into two daughter cells.

Step 1: DNA Replication. Just before the cell divides, its DNA is copied in a process called DNA replication. This results in two identical chromosomes instead of just one. This step is necessary so that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its own chromosome.

Step 2: Chromosome Segregation. The two chromosomes then attach themselves to different parts of the cell membrane. Segregation or separation of the chromosomes occurs as they move to opposite ends of the cell during the cell separation process.

Step 3: Separation. A new cell membrane starts growing into the center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two daughter cells. New cell wall must also form around the two cells. This new developing cell walls between the cells is known as a division septum. As the cell begins to pull apart, the new and the original chromosomes are separated. The two daughter cells that result are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.





Figure 7.2

In binary fission, the single chromosome is copied and eventually separates into two separate chromosomes, the cell grows larger, and two identical cells form by the formation of new cell membrane (and cell wall) and the division of the cytoplasm.



Under ideal conditions, reproduction in bacteria is extremely efficient, with some bacteria reproducing every 20 minutes. This makes bacteria an extremely effective tool for the molecular biologist. However, bacteria do not usually live in ideal conditions; otherwise, bacteria would grow and divide extremely rapidly, eventually covering the surface of Earth. Bacterial growth is limited by nutrients and water, predation, and by their own wastes.

You can watch an animation of binary fission at this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_fission_anim.gif .



Figure 7.3

Cell division is relatively simple in prokaryotic cells. The two cells divide by binary fission. Green and orange lines indicate old and newly-generated bacterial cell walls, respectively. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells. Left, growth at the center of bacterial body, such as in Bacillus subtilis and E. coli . Right, apical growth from the ends of the bacterial body, such as in Corynebacterium diphtheriae .

Eukaryotic Cell Division - Advanced


Describe cell division in eukaryotes.

Explain the main differences between cell division in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.





Are these cells prokaryotic or eukaryotic?

Notice the nucleus. Eukaryotic cell division is more complicated than prokaryotic division because of this organelle. Having more than one chromosome and ensuring that all daughter cells receive a full compliment of chromosomes is no easy task.





Cell Division in Eukaryotes


Though cell division in all cells results in one cell becoming two cells, cell division in eukaryotic organisms is very different from that in prokaryotes, mainly because of the many chromosomes in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells . Cell division in eukaryotic organisms is necessary for development, growth, and repair of the organism. Just as in binary fission, eukaryotic cell division ensures that each resulting daughter cell receives a complete copy of the organism’s entire genome. Remember that all of an organism’s DNA must be present in each somatic, or body, cell. This DNA contains the information necessary for that cell to perform its functions, and to give that organism its traits. Therefore, prior to cell division, the eukaryotic cell’s complete genome must be copied, a process known as DNA replication , ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of the genome. Prior to cell division, the cell's organelles are also duplicated. Now the cell is ready to divide. Cell division occurs at the end of an eukaryotic cell's cell cycle .

Eukaryotic cell division occurs in two major steps:

The first step is mitosis , a multi-phase process in which the nucleus of the cell divides. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a diploid number of chromosomes. In humans, that number of chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs). Mitosis is described in greater detail in Cell Cycle: Mitosis (Advanced) . Because the DNA has replicated prior to mitosis, the two nuclei that result from mitosis are genetically identical.

The second major step is cytokinesis . As in prokaryotic cells, the cytoplasm must divide. Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.





Figure 7.4

Shown are cells in various stages of their cell cycle. Numerous dividing cells are evident.



The formation of gametes , an organism’s reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg cells, involves a completely different method of cell division, called meiosis . This cell division ensures that each gamete receives a haploid number (half the amount) of chromosomes.

Chromosomal Division - Advanced


Describe the basic properties of chromosomes.





How is it assured that every cell in your body has the same DNA?

Chromosomes, like those shown here, must form prior to cell division, to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material. Each chromosome is made of two identical sister chromatids. Each chromatid is 1/2 of the "X." Essentially, each daughter cell receives half of each "X-shaped" chromosome.





DNA, Chromosomes, and Genes


DNA contains the information necessary to make proteins, direct a cell’s activities, and give an organism its traits. Obviously, it is a very important molecule. Actually , in human cells, DNA is organized into 46 molecules called chromosomes. See DNA is packaged in a chromosome at http://www.dnaftb.org/29/animation.html to see Roger Kornberg speak about his work.

The information in DNA is organized into structural units scattered along the length of the DNA molecule. These units are known as genes . A gene contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein. A diploid human cell has about 44,000 genes; two copies of each of about 22,000 genes. So, a single DNA molecule contains hundreds to thousands of genes. Through the process of gene expression, which involves transcription and translation , different cell types use the information in different genes to make different proteins. This process gives different cell types distinct activities. Thus, a liver cell will have many different proteins than a kidney cell, giving the two cells types distinct activities. When a cell is using the information within a gene, the segment of DNA containing that gene is unwound as chromatin , exposing the double helix to the cell machinery needed to use that information.

Prior to cell division, the DNA must duplicate itself in a process called DNA replication. This ensures that each resulting cell receives a complete set of the organism’s genome. But how is the replicated DNA divided up evenly? This will be discussed in an additional concept.

What guarantees that each new cell will receive a complete set of DNA? It was the identification of chromosomes that allowed this process to be characterized. As a eukaryotic cell prepares to divide, the DNA and associated proteins (histones) coil into a chromosome ( Figure below ). The DNA copies itself prior to this process, so the chromosome that forms consists of two identical chromatids, known as sister chromatids , identical copies of DNA. The two chromatids are attached at a region called the centromere. The chromatids separate from each other when the nucleus divides just prior to cell division. Thus, each new cell that results after cell division will have the complete compliment of genetic material, identical to the original, or parent, cell. In human cells, this amounts to 46 chromosomes. These chromosomes come in pairs (one from each pair inherited from each parent). So these 46 chromosomes are actually two sets of 23 chromosomes each.

For an animation of how the DNA coils into a chromosome, see http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/media/DNAi_packaging_vo2-sm.mov .



Figure 7.5

(left) The DNA double helix wraps around proteins (2) and tightly coils a number of times to form a chromosome (5). This figure shows the complexity of the coiling process. The red dot shows the location of the centromere, where the microtubules attach during mitosis and meiosis. (right) A representation of a condensed eukaryotic chromosome, as seen after the DNA has been copied. The chromosome is made of two identical, or sister, chromatids held together by a centromere.



Each human somatic cell (a body cell, or every cell other than a gamete) normally has two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. These cells are said to have a diploid number of chromosomes. Each set contains 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome differs in size, from about 250 million nucleotide pairs on the largest chromosome (chromosome #1) to less than 50 million nucleotide pairs on chromosome #22. Each chromosome contains a specific set of genes, as well as regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences, making each chromosome essential to survival.





Homologous Chromosomes


Each pair of chromosomes consists of two chromosomes that are similar in size and shape. They contain the same genes at the same loci , though they may have different alleles. These pairs of chromosomes are known as homologous chromosomes , or homologues . Upon fertilization, a zygote is formed ( Figure below ). A zygote is the first cell of a new individual. In humans, a zygote contains 23 pairs (or two sets) of chromosomes. Any cell containing two sets of chromosomes is said to be diploid. The zygote forms from the fusion of two haploid gametes. A haploid cell contains one set of chromosomes. In humans, a haploid gamete contains 23 chromosomes. Biologists use the symbol n to represent one set of chromosomes, and 2n to represent two sets.



Figure 7.6

Homologous chromosomes form a pair, one from each parent. Homologous chromosomes are similar in size and shape, and contain the same genes, though they may have different alleles. Alleles are alternative forms of the same gene. This diagram represents two pairs of homologous chromosomes.





Figure 7.7

Upon fertilization a diploid zygote is formed. In humans, a zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 inherited from each parent. The gametes, sperm and eggs, are haploid cells, with 23 chromosomes each.





Sex Chromosomes


In humans, each set of chromosomes contains 22 autosomes and 1 sex chromosome . Autosomes are chromosomes that are not directly involved in determining the sex of an individual. The sex chromosomes contain genes that determine the sex of an individual.

Whereas autosomes are found as homologous pairs in somatic cells, sex chromosomes come in two different sizes, shapes, and contain different genes. In many organisms, including humans, the sex chromosomes are known as the X and Y chromosomes. The Y chromosome contains genes that cause male development. Therefore, any individual with a Y chromosome is male, and a male will have both an X and Y chromosome (XY). Females, without a Y chromosome, will have two X chromosomes (XX). As females have two X chromosomes, they must pass an X chromosome to all of their children. As males have both an X chromosome (inherited from their mother) and a Y chromosome, they can give either chromosome to their children. If a child inherits a Y from his father, he will be male; if a child inherits an X from her father, she will be female. It therefore is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. See Specialized chromosomes determine gender at http://www.dnaftb.org/9/animation.html for an animation on the identification of sex chromosomes.

What is a cell's life like?

The eukaryotic cell spends most of its "life" in interphase of the cell cycle, which can be subdivided into the three phases, G1, S and G2. During interphase, the cell does what it is supposed to do. Though cells have many common functions, such as DNA replication, they also have certain specific functions. That is, during the life of a heart cell, the cell would obviously perform certain different activities than a kidney cell or a liver cell. The remainder of the cell cycle is devoted to cell division: dividing the nucleus and cytoplasm. During interphase, the DNA is unwound as chromatin, so that it can be exposed to the cellular machinery.





The Cell Cycle


Cell division in eukaryotic cells is much more complex than in prokaryotic cells because of the many chromosomes within the nucleus. Both the cytoplasm and the genetic material must be divided, ensuring that each resulting daughter cell receives 46 separate chromosomes (in human cell). To ensure this, in addition to the cell performing its necessary functions, the DNA must be copied, as must many organelles, prior to cell division.

The life of a eukaryotic cell is a cycle, known as the cell cycle ( Figure below ). The cell cycle is a repeating series of cellular growth and division. The cell cycle has four phases: the first growth (G 1 ) phase, the synthesis (S) phase, the second growth (G 2 ) phase, and the mitotic ( mitosis ) phase, which ends with cytokinesis . The cell spends the majority of the cycle in the first three phases of the cycle, collectively known as interphase . After cytokinesis, two genetically identical daughter cells are formed. Progression of the cycle into each phase is dependent on the completion of the previous phase. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered the resting phase or the G 0 phase, a indefinite phase of quiescence. The cell cycle is a vital process by which a zygote develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs consistently regenerated. After cytokinesis, each resulting daughter cell is in G 1 of the next cell cycle. http://www.cellsalive.com/cell_cycle.htm has an excellent animation of the cell cycle.



Figure 7.8

This diagram represents the cell cycle in eukaryotes. The cell cycle depicts the life of an eukaryotic cell. The cell cycle has four phases: the first growth or gap (G 1 ) phase, the synthesis (S) phase, the second growth or gap (G 2 ) phase and the mitotic (M) phase. The M phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis. The cell spends the majority of the cycle in the first three phases (G 1 , S, G 2 ) of the cycle, collectively known as interphase. After cytokinesis, two genetically identical daughter cells are formed.





The Phases


The cell spends most of its life in the first gap (sometimes referred to as growth) phase, G 1 . During this phase, a cell undergoes rapid growth and the cell performs its routine functions. During this phase the biosynthetic and metabolic activities of the cell occur at a high rate. The synthesis of amino acids and hundreds of thousands or millions of proteins that are required by the cell occurs during this phase. Proteins produced include those needed for DNA replication. If a cell is not dividing, the cell enters the G 0 phase from this phase.



The G 0 phase is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. Non-dividing cells in multicellular eukaryotic organisms enter G 0 from G 1 . These cells may remain in G 0 for long periods of time, even indefinitely, such as with neurons. Cells that are completely differentiated may also enter G 0 . Some cells stop dividing when issues of sustainability or viability of their daughter cells arise, such as with DNA damage or degradation, a process called cellular senescence . Cellular senescence occurs when normal diploid cells lose the ability to divide, normally after about 50 cell divisions.



Dividing cells enter the Synthesis (S) phase from G 1 . For two genetically identical daughter cells to be formed, the cell’s DNA must be copied through DNA replication. When the DNA is replicated, both strands of the double helix are used as templates to produce two new complementary strands. These new strands then hydrogen bond to the template strands and two double helices form. During this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the cell remains in a diploid state.



The second gap (growth) (G 2 ) phase is a shortened growth period in which many organelles are reproduced or manufactured. Parts necessary for mitosis and cell division are made during G 2 , including microtubules used in the mitotic spindle.



Mitosis is the phase of nuclear division, in which one nucleus divides and becomes two nuclei. Mitosis itself is a multi-phase process and will be the focus of the Cell Cycle: Mitosis (Advanced) concept. Immediately following mitosis is cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm divides in half, producing two daughter cells, each containing a complete set of genetic material.

Mitosis - Advanced


Identify and describe the main processes in mitosis.





How do all your cells stay genetically identical?

Mitosis, of course. As you can see, mitosis is a multistage process that ensures separation of sister chromatids, and ensures that daughter cells are just like the parent cell.





Mitosis


Mitosis is the division of the cell’s nucleus, the final step before two daughter cells are produced. Mitosis begins immediately at the conclusion of interphase, specifically at the end of the G 2 phase. The cell enters mitosis as it approaches its size limitations. Four distinct phases of mitosis have been recognized: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, with each phase merging into the next one ( Figure below ). See All cells arise from pre-existing cells at http://www.dnaftb.org/7/animation.html for an animation of Walther Flemming discussing his description of mitosis. http://www.biology.arizona.edu/Cell_bio/tutorials/cell_cycle/MitosisFlash.html has an excellent animation of mitosis.



Figure 7.9

Mitosis is the phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle that occurs between DNA replication and the formation of two daughter cells. What happens during mitosis? During mitosis, the nucleus divides, paving the way for two cells to be produced after cell division, each with a complete makeup of genetic material.





The Phases


The phases of mitosis are discussed in the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLKX_4DHE3I (20:42).

Prophase


Prophase is the first and longest phase of mitosis, see Figure below . During prophase, the chromatin (DNA) coils up into visible chromosomes, each made up of two sister chromatids held together by the centromere. Also during this phase, the nucleolus disappears, and the spindle begins to form from the centrioles. Most eukaryotic cells contain structures known as centrosomes, consisting of a pair of centrioles. During prophase, the centrioles begin to move to opposite ends, or poles, of the cell. As the centrioles migrate, the fiber-like spindle begins to elongate between the centrioles. The spindle is a thin, cage-like structure made out of microtubules. In plant cells, the spindle forms without centrioles. The spindle plays an essential role moving chromosomes and in the separation of sister chromatids.



Figure 7.10

The spindle starts to form during prophase of mitosis. Kinetochores on the spindle attach to the centromeres of sister chromatids.



Preprophase

As plant cells have some structural differences compared to an animal cell, an additional stage prior to prophase is necessary. In plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a preprophase stage. Plant cells have a large central vacuole encompassing the center of the cell. Prior to the division of the nucleus, the nucleus must migrate to the center of the plant cell. To accomplish this, the cell forms a phragmosome , a sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the middle of the cell. The phragmosome suspends the cell nucleus in the center of the cell in preparation for prophase. Additionally, during this phase the plane of cell division is established. The accurate control of division planes, which establishes the placement of the future cell wall, is crucial for the correct structure of plant tissues and organs.

The mitotic spindle also starts to form during preprophase in plant cells. Unlike animal cells, plant cells do not have centrosomes to organize their mitotic spindles. Instead, in these cells, the nuclear envelope acts as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) for spindle formation. The preprophase spindle forms by self-assembly of microtubules in the cytoplasm surrounding the nuclear envelope.





Prometaphase


During early prometaphase , the nuclear membrane disintegrates and microtubule spindles invade the center of the cell. Also during this phase, the spindle attaches to the centromere of each chromatid. Specifically, the spindle attaches to the kinetochore , a protein structure on the centromere where the spindle fibers attach.





Metaphase


During metaphase , the centromeres of the chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate or equatorial plane, in essence the approximate middle of the cell. This orientation of the chromosomes at the equator of the cell helps to ensure proper chromosome separation. This alignment allows the spindle fibers to correctly pull the chromatids to either pole of the cell, resulting in separation of sister chromatids from a chromosome, see Figure below .



Figure 7.11

Chromosomes, consisting of sister chromatids, line up at the equator (metaphase plate) of the cell during metaphase.





Anaphase


Anaphase is the phase in which the sister chromatids separate. The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the microtubules of the spindles, similar to the reeling in of a fish by the shortening of the fishing line. One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole. This process occurs when the proteins that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, resulting in unattached identical chromosomes, essentially separate daughter chromosomes. These separate chromosomes are pulled apart by shortening spindle fibers, and pulled toward the centrosomes to which they are attached. At the end of anaphase the spindle fibers degrade. At this time, each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes, identical to the amount of DNA at the beginning of G 1 of the cell cycle.





Telophase


Telophase is essentially the opposite of prophase and prometaphase. The chromosomes begin to unwind back into chromatin in preparation to direct the cell’s metabolic activities. A new nucleus forms around each set of chromosomes. This is followed by cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two genetically identical cells, ready to enter G 1 of the next cell cycle. The phases of mitosis are summarized in Figure below .



Figure 7.12

Mitosis in the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle. Mitosis is the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides. In this diagram, prometaphase is not included as a separate phase, but incorporated into prophase.





Figure 7.13

This is a representation of dividing plant cells. Cell division in plant cells differs slightly from animal cells as a cell wall must form. Note that most of the cells are in interphase. Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?





Cytokinesis


Cytokinesis is the final step in cell division. It often occurs concurrently with telophase, though it is a separate process. Cytokinesis ( Figure below ) differs between plant and animal cells. In animal cells, the plasma membrane pinches inward along the cell’s equator until two cells are formed. Specifically, a cleavage furrow containing a contractile ring develops in approximately the middle of the cell (similar to the position of the metaphase plate), essentially pinching off the two nuclei and forming separate cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the cells equator. A new membrane grows along each side of the cell plate, with a new cell wall forming on the outside of each new membrane.

At the end of cytokinesis, each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase, the end of one cell cycle, and the beginning of G 1 and interphase of the next cell cycle.



Figure 7.14

Cytokinesis is the final stage of eukaryotic cell division. It occurs differently in animal (left) and plant (right) cells.

Review


Order the phases of mitosis.

Describe the main processes involved in mitosis.

Differentiate cytokinesis in animal and plant cells.

Four phases of mitosis: can you describe what happens in each phase?





Cell Cycle Regulation - Advanced


Describe how the cell cycle is controlled/regulated.





What would happen if this cycle proceeds at will?

Your cells may grow and divide without performing their necessary functions, or without fully replicating their DNA, or without copying their organelles. Probably not much good could come of that. So the cell cycle needs to be highly regulated and tightly controlled. And it is.





Control of the Cell Cycle


How does the cell know when to divide? How does the cell know when to replicate its DNA? How does the cell know when to proceed into mitosis or cytokinesis? The answers to these questions have to do with the control of the cell cycle. But how is the cell cycle controlled or regulated? Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell. These include the detection and repair of damage to DNA, as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. Uncontrolled cell division can be deadly to an organism; its prevention is critical for survival.





Cyclins and Kinases


The cell cycle is controlled by a number of protein-controlled feedback processes. Two types of proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle are kinases and cyclins . Cyclins activate kinases by binding to them, specifically they activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) . Cyclins comprise a group of proteins that are rapidly produced at key stages in the cell cycle. Once activated by a cyclin, CDK are enzymes that activate or inactivate other target molecules through phosphorylation. It is this precise regulation of proteins that triggers advancement through the cell cycle. Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these critical proteins.





Cyclin-Dependent Kinases


Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. CDKs are present in all eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. CDKs are small proteins with little more than the kinase domain. A CDK binds to a cyclin regulatory protein, activating the protein; without binding to cyclin, the CDK has little kinase activity. CDKs phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines, so they are serine-threonine kinases. CDKs are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells.





Checkpoints


The cell cycle has key checkpoints. When the cell receives key signals or information via feedback regulation , the cell can begin the next phase of the cell cycle. The cell can also receive signals that delay passage to the next phase of the cell cycle. These signals allow the cell to complete the previous phase before moving forward. Three key checkpoints are the cell growth (G 1 ) checkpoint, the G 2 checkpoint, and the mitosis checkpoint. The DNA synthesis checkpoint is another checkpoint.

The cell growth (G 1 ) checkpoint allows the cell to proceed into the S phase of the cell cycle and continue on to divide, or delay division, or enter a resting stage. The cell spends most of the cycle in the G 1 phase. G 1 is where the cell carries out its main functions. If the cell has performed its functions and has grown to significant size to be divided in half, key proteins will signal the cell to proceed to the S phase and stimulate DNA replication to begin. If the cells are not to divide, such as some muscle and nerve cells, the cell will stop at this checkpoint and move into a resting phase, G 0 . Some cells may stay in this resting period permanently, never dividing.

The second checkpoint is located at the end of G 2 phase. Passing this checkpoint triggers the start of the mitosis. If this checkpoint is passed, the cell initiates the many molecular processes that signal the beginning of mitosis.

The mitosis checkpoint determines the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next. This checkpoint occurs at the point in metaphase where all the chromosomes should have aligned at the metaphase plate. This checkpoint signals the beginning of anaphase, allowing the cell to complete mitosis and prepare for the beginning of G 1 of the next cell cycle.

The DNA synthesis (S) checkpoint determines if the cell is ready for mitosis. DNA repair enzymes check the replicated DNA at this point. If the checkpoint is passed, the many molecular mechanisms and processes needed for mitosis will begin.



Figure 7.16

Checkpoints in the eukaryotic cell cycle ensure that the cell is ready to proceed before it moves on to the next phase of the cycle. In this diagram the G 1 , S, and M checkpoints are shown.

Gene Regulation and Cancer - Advanced


Define cancer and describe the relationship between cancer and the cell cycle.





An uncontrolled mass of cells. Why?

This uncontrolled mass of cells is a tumor. If allowed to continue to grow, it will kill the organism. Why does it form? There are a number of factors that allow cancer to form, but they all have to do with allowing the cell cycle to proceed without regulation.





Cancer and the Cell Cycle


Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the body. Cancerous cells are also called malignant cells. There are over 200 different known cancers that afflict humans.

Many cancers result from uncontrolled cell division, when the regulation of the cycle is lost ( Figure below ). Recall that the cell cycle is the normal life of a cell. During this cycle, the cell performs its necessary functions, replicates its DNA and organelles, and divides through mitosis and cytokinesis, such that two genetically identical cells result. The cycle is highly regulated so that no phase proceeds before it is ready to do so.



Figure 7.17

When normal cells are damaged beyond repair, they are eliminated. The upper diagram depicts damaged cells being destroyed. Cancer cells avoid elimination and, because of uncontrolled cell division, continue to multiply in an unregulated manner. The lower diagram depicts damaged cells dividing in an uncontrolled fashion.



Uncontrolled growth of cells may happen because a cell’s DNA becomes damaged. Cancerous cells divide much more rapidly than healthy cells. These cells use the blood and nutrients that other cells need and they can stress the environment of the healthy cells. As cancerous cells do not provide any useful function to the organism, they are extremely harmful. If cancerous cells are allowed to grow uncontrolled, they may form a mass of abnormal cells called a tumor (see Figure below ) and could kill the host organism.



Figure 7.18

These cells are cancer cells, growing out of control and forming a tumor.



Many cancerous cells are the products of normal cells that have lost the ability to regulate the cell cycle. The genes that encode the proteins involved in cell cycle regulation have mutations. One category of genes, called oncogenes, accelerate the cell cycle. Some cancers can be inherited, such as breast cancer (due to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes). Approximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary. Other cancers are triggered by an environmental stimulus, such as through the relationship between tobacco smoke and lung cancer, or ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer.





Oncogenes


Officially, an oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. Normally, a cell can only grow and divide through a certain number of cell cycles. The cell will eventually die, in a process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis . Oncogenes are able to extend the lives of cells that are normally programmed to die. These cells proliferate and continue through additional cell cycles. Luckily, most oncogenes cannot work alone. They require an additional factor, such as a mutation in another gene, environmental factors such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet radiation, or a viral infection, to cause cancer. Additional information on oncogenes will be discussed in additional concepts. Proto-oncogenes are normal versions of oncogenes; an oncogene is a mutated version of a proto-oncogene. Proto-oncogene products are necessary for the cell to function and maintain homeostasis. They are involved in cell proliferation, the cell cycle, signal transduction, gene regulation and other processes.

Asexual Reproduction - Advanced


Describe asexual reproduction; explain the genetic relationship between parent and offspring.





One parent or two?

That is the main difference between sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is combining genetic material from two parents, usually from two gametes. How the two cells combine may take many forms, but does not necessarily involve physical contact. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically distinct from other offspring and from their parents. Asexual reproduction produces offspring from just one parent. These offspring are genetically identical to that one parent.





Reproduction


Some organisms look and act exactly like their parent. Others share many similar traits, but they are definitely unique individuals. Some species have two parents, whereas others have just one. How an organism reproduces determines the amount of similarity the organism will have to its parent. Reproduction is the process by which organisms give rise to offspring. It is one of the defining characteristics of living things. There are two basic types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Each of these processes ensures that the parental generation gives genetic material, DNA, to its offspring.

The process of cell division is how multicellular organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled organisms, asexual reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, whereas sexual reproduction produces a similar, but genetically unique offspring. In sexual reproduction, meiosis produces haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote ( Figure below ). In other words, a child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent. Look at the family in Figure below . The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents. The children, of course, result from sexual reproduction.



Figure 7.19

Fertilization of an egg cell by a sperm cell. In sexual reproduction, haploid gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote.





Figure 7.20

Family Portrait: Mother, Daughter, Father, and Son. Children resemble their parents, but they are never identical to them. Do you know why this is the case?





Asexual Reproduction




Figure 7.21

Do animals always have two parents?



No, not all animals have two parents. Sometimes animals can be made from just one parent. This Komodo dragon, for example, only has a mother and reproduces by parthenogenesis. Asexual reproduction is the process of creating offspring from just one parent.

Are there male and female bacteria? How could you tell? Remember, bacteria have just one chromosome; they do not have an X or Y chromosome. So they probably have a very simplified form of reproduction. Asexual reproduction, the simplest and most primitive method of reproduction, involves a single parent and produces a clone , an organism that is genetically identical to the parent. Haploid gametes are not involved in asexual reproduction. A parent passes all of its genetic material to the next generation. All prokaryotic and some eukaryotic organisms reproduce asexually.

Asexual reproduction can be very rapid. This is an advantage for many organisms. It allows these organisms to crowd out other organisms that reproduce more slowly. Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacterial cells in just a few hours. However, most bacteria do not live under ideal conditions. If they did, the entire surface of the planet would soon be covered with them. Instead, their reproduction is kept in check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes. This is true of most other organisms as well.

There are a number of types of asexual reproduction including fission, fragmentation, budding, vegetative reproduction, spore formation and agamogenesis. Spore formation occurs in plants, and some algae and fungi, and will be discussed in additional concepts.



Figure 7.22

Binary Fission in various single-celled organisms (left). Cell division is a relatively simple process in many single-celled organisms. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells. In multiple fission (right), a multinucleated cell can divide to form more than one daughter cell. Multiple fission is more often observed among protists.





Fission


In fission (or binary fission), a parent separates into two or more individuals of about equal size. This type of reproduction is common among single-celled organisms including bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes, such as protists and some fungi. The single cell divides into two daughter cells.





Fragmentation


In fragmentation , a body breaks into several fragments, which later develop into complete organisms. For example, a new starfish ( Figure below ) can develop from a single ray, or arm. In addition to starfish, this type of reproduction is common among some worms, fungi and plants. Many of these organisms are also capable of sexual reproduction. Most lichens, which form from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation. This ensures that new individuals contain both symbionts.





Budding


In budding , organisms reproduce by having new individuals split off from existing ones, which results in genetically identical parent and daughter organisms. The bud may stay attached or break free from the parent. Eukaryotic organisms, such as the single cell yeast and multicellular hydra, undergo budding ( Figure below ).



Figure 7.23

Starfish reproduce by fragmentation and yeasts reproduce by budding. Both are types of asexual reproduction.





Vegetative Reproduction


Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants. This type of reproduction occurs when new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores. The formation of new plants out of rhizomes or stolons is an example of vegetative reproductive, such as in the strawberry plant. Other plants use this type of reproduction to reproduce through bulbs or tubers, or shoots and suckers that form along lateral roots. See the Plant Biology concepts for additional information.



Figure 7.24

These strawberry plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction. New strawberries grow out of stolons, a specialized type of horizontal above-ground shoot.





Agamogenesis


Agamogenesis is any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. These include are parthenogenesis and apomixis. Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in aphids, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, as well as in many plants and certain lizards, such as the Komodo dragon. Apomixis is asexual reproduction, without fertilization, in plants.





Asexual Reproduction Summary


Asexual Reproduction Summary Type Description Example Organisms

Fission Occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells of the same size. Bacteria, Protists, Unicellular Fungi

Fragmentation Occurs when a parent organism breaks into fragments, or pieces, and each fragment develops into a new organism. Starfish, some worms, fungi, plants, lichens

Budding Occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent cell while it grows and develops. When the bud is fully developed, it breaks away from the parent cell and forms a new organism. Yeast, Hydra

Vegetative Reproduction Occurs when new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores. Plants

Agamogenesis Any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. Many plants and some animals.

Review


What is reproduction?

Describe three types of asexual reproduction?

Define gamete and zygote. What number of chromosomes does each have?

Compare and contrast asexual and sexual reproduction.





Sexual Reproduction - Advanced


Describe sexual reproduction; explain the genetic relationship between parent and offspring.





Sexual vs, Asexual. What's the main difference?

Truly, it's just that sexual reproduction is the combining of sex cells from two parents, each providing half the amount of genetic material.





Sexual Reproduction


Why do you look similar to your parents, but not identical? First, it is because you have two parents. Second, it is because of sexual reproduction. Whereas asexual reproduction produces genetically identical clones, sexual reproduction produces genetically diverse individuals. Sexual reproduction is the creation of a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms. As both parents contribute half of the new organism’s genetic material, the offspring will have traits of both parents, but will not be exactly like either parent.

Organisms that reproduce sexually by joining gametes , a process known as fertilization , must have a mechanism to produce haploid gametes. This mechanism is meiosis , a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes. Meiosis occurs only in gamete producing cells within the gonads. During meiosis the pairs of chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair. Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between, starting with one diploid cell and generating four haploid cells ( Figure below ). Each division, named meiosis I and meiosis II, has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. These stages are similar to those of mitosis, but there are distinct and important differences.

Prior to meiosis, the cell’s DNA is replicated, generating chromosomes with two sister chromatids. A human cell prior to meiosis will have 46 chromosomes, 22 pairs of homologous autosomes, and 1 pair of sex chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes , or homologues, are similar in size, shape, and genetic content; they contain the same genes, though they may have different alleles of those genes. The genes/alleles are at the same loci on homologous chromosomes. You inherit one chromosome of each pair of homologues from your mother and the other one from your father. Sexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of multicellular organisms, including almost all animals and plants. Fertilization joins two haploid gametes into a diploid zygote, the first cell of a new organism. The zygote enters G 1 of the first cell cycle, and the organism begins to grow and develop through mitosis and cell division.



Figure 7.25

During meiosis the number of chromosomes is reduced from a diploid number ( 2n ) to a haploid number ( n ). During fertilization, haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes ( 2n ) is restored.

Meiosis - Advanced


Identify and describe the main steps of meiosis, distinguishing between the quantity of genetic material in the parent and resulting cells.





How do you make a cell with half the DNA?

Meiosis. This process allows cells to have half the number of chromosomes, so two of these cells can come back together to form a new organism with the complete number of chromosomes. It not only helps produce gametes, it also ensures genetic variation.





Meiosis


Fertilization joins haploid gametes into a diploid zygote. How do gametes end up with half the amount, a haploid amount, of DNA? The mechanism that produces haploid cells is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes. Meiosis is specific to gamete producing cells in the gonads. Meiosis begins with a diploid cell and ends with four haploid cells. These cells eventually differentiate into mature sperm or egg cells. During meiosis the pairs of homologous chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair. Only germ cells like spermatocytes and oocytes, can undergo meiosis.



Figure 7.26

Overview of Meiosis. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different daughter cells. This diagram shows just the nuclei of the cells. Notice the exchange of genetic material that occurs prior to the first cell division.



Prior to meiosis, the cell’s DNA is replicated, generating chromosomes with two sister chromatids. Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between, so the DNA is not replicated prior to the second round of divisions. Each division, named meiosis I and meiosis II, has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. These stages are similar to those of mitosis, but there are distinct and important differences.

A human cell prior to meiosis will have 46 chromosomes, 22 pairs of homologous autosomes, and 1 pair of sex chromosomes. At the end of meiosis, each haploid cell will have 22 autosomes (not pairs) and 1 sex chromosome, either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. You inherit one chromosome of each pair from your mother and the other one from your father.

The Eight Phases


Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle. In both meiosis I and meiosis II , cells go through the same four phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis. The eight stages of meiosis are summarized below. The stages will be described for a human cell, starting with 46 chromosomes.



Figure 7.27

Phases of Meiosis. This flowchart of meiosis shows meiosis I in greater detail than meiosis II. Meiosis I—but not meiosis II—differs somewhat from mitosis. Compare meiosis I in this flowchart with the earlier figure featuring mitosis. How does meiosis I differ from mitosis?





Meiosis I


Meiosis I is referred to as a reductional division; it separates homologous chromosomes, producing two haploid cells. The starting diploid cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs of homologous chromosomes), each containing two sister chromatids attached at the centromere. After cytokinesis at the end of meiosis I, two haploid cells result. These cells contain 23 chromosomes, although each still contains two sister chromatids. Meiosis I separates the homologous pairs of chromosomes; one from each pair ends up in each resulting cell.





Prophase I


Prophase I is the longest phase of meiosis. It is very similar to prophase of mitosis, but with one very significant difference. In Prophase I, the nuclear envelope breaks down, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the centrioles begin to migrate to opposite poles of the cell, with the spindle fibers growing between them. During this time, the homologous chromosomes form pairs. These homologous chromosomes line up gene-for-gene down their entire length tetrads , allowing crossing-over to occur. This process is also called homologous recombination , and is an important step in creating genetic variation.

Prophase I can be further divided into 5 distinct stages: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis.

Leptotene



The first stage of prophase I is the leptotene stage. During this stage, chromatin condenses into visible (under the microscope) chromosomes within the nucleus. Each chromosome contains two sister chromatids, and each chromosome has a homologue present in the nucleus. During this stage, the synaptonemal complex begins to assemble.

Zygotene



The zygotene stage occurs as the chromosomes pair with their homologue forming homologous chromosome pairs, a process called synapsis . Homologous chromosomes are equal in size and genetic content, so the genes from the two chromosomes line up along the length of the chromosome. Therefore, the pairing is highly specific and exact. The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes, as they are formed by a complex with four chromatids.

Pachytene



The pachytene stage is the stage when chromosomal crossover (crossing-over) occurs. This is the process where non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange segments over regions of homology. At the sites of genetic exchange, chiasmata form. This exchange of DNA results in genetic recombination , the formation of new combinations of alleles. This process is much more common in autosomes than in sex chromosomes.

Diplotene



The diplotene stage is when the synaptonemal complex degrades and homologous chromosomes disassociate slightly from each other, though they are still bound at the chiasmata (the regions of recombination).

In human fetal oogenesis, all developing oocytes develop to this stage and the stop. This happens in all females prior to birth. This suspended state of the oocytes is referred to as the dictyotene stage and the eggs remains in this stage until released following puberty.

Diakinesis



During the diakinesis stage, chromosomes further condense. The chiasmata remain intact during this stage. The remainder of this stage is similar to prometaphase of mitosis: the nucleoli disappear, the nuclear membrane disintegrates, and the meiotic spindle begins to form.





Metaphase I


In metaphase I, the 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes line up along the equator or the metaphase plate of the cell. During mitosis, 46 individual chromosomes line up during metaphase, however during meiosis I, the 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes line up. Chromosomes pairs are moved into position by the spindle fibers, which are now attached to the kinetochores at the centromeres. Some chromosomes inherited from the father are facing one side of the cell, and some are facing the other side. This is the basis of independent assortment of chromosomes as suggested by Gregor Mendel.





Anaphase I


During anaphase I the spindle fibers shorten, and the homologous chromosome pairs are separated from each other. This occurs as the chiasmata are severed, pulling homologous chromosomes apart. One chromosome from each pair moves toward one pole, with the other moving toward the other pole, resulting in a cell with 23 chromosomes at one pole and the other 23 at the other pole. Each chromosome still contains a pair of sister chromatids; the sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere.

Because human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, this independent assortment of chromosomes produces 2 23 , or 8,388,608 possible chromosome configurations. More on independent assortment of chromosomes will be presented in the concepts on Mendelian Genetics.





Telophase I


Telophase I followed by cytokinesis ends the first division of meiosis. This reduction division results in two haploid cells, each with a unique combination of chromosomes, some from the father and the rest from the mother. At this time, each chromosome is comprised of a pair of sister chromatids, even though one has undergone recombination with its homologue.

During telophase I, the spindle fiber disassembles and the nucleus reforms. The genetic material briefly uncoils back into chromatin. This is quickly followed by cytokinesis. Cells may enter a period of rest known as interkinesis or interphase II, or immediately enter meiosis II. No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II.





Meiosis II


Meiosis II includes a division of the chromosomes, similar to that of mitosis. This division separates the sister chromatids. After cytokinesis, four haploid cells result, each with 23 chromosomes. Now each chromosome contains the equivalent of material from one chromatid. Thus, when two of these cells join in fertilization, the resulting diploid zygote has just as much DNA as a cell after mitotic cell division.





Prophase II


In prophase II, once again the nucleolus disappears and the nucleus breaks down. The chromatin condenses into chromosomes. The spindle begins to reform as the centrioles move to opposite sides of the cell.





Metaphase II


During metaphase II, the spindle fibers align the 23 chromosomes, each made out of two chromatids, along the equator of the cell. The new metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate.





Anaphase II


Anaphase II separates chromatids, similar to anaphase of mitosis. During anaphase II, sister chromatids are separated as the centromeres are cleaved. The chromatids move to opposite poles of the cell. As the chromatids separate, each is known as a chromosome. Anaphase II results in a cell with 23 chromosomes at each pole of the cell; each chromosome contains half as much genetic material as at the start of anaphase II.





Telophase II


Telophase II and cytokinesis end meiosis. During this last phase of meiosis, the nucleus reforms and the spindle fibers break down. The chromosomes uncoil into chromatin. Each cell undergoes cytokinesis, producing four haploid cells, each with a unique combination of genes and chromosomes.



Figure 7.28

Meiosis, divided into meiosis I and meiosis II, is a process in which a diploid cell divides itself into four haploid cells. Note that meiosis II immediately follows meiosis I; DNA replication does not occur after meiosis I. Notice how the chromosomes align in prophase I. The alignment of homologous chromosomes allows for crossing-over, a process that increases genetic variability, which will be discussed in more detail in another concept.

Explain why sexual reproduction results in genetically unique offspring.

Name and describe the processes shown in this diagram.





Genetic Variation - Advanced


Explain why and how sexual reproduction leads to variation in offspring.





What helps ensure the survival of a species?

Genetic variation. It is this variation that is the essence of evolution. Without genetic differences among individuals, "survival of the fittest" would not be likely. Everyone would be exactly the same. How would it be determined who could or would survive? Either all survive, or all perish.





Meiosis and Genetic Variation


Sexual reproduction results in infinite possibilities of genetic variation. In other words, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically unique. They differ from both parents and also from each other. This occurs through a number of mechanisms, including crossing-over, the independent assortment of chromosomes during anaphase I, and random fertilization.

When homologous chromosomes form pairs during prophase I of meiosis I, crossing-over can occur. Crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. It results in new combinations of genes on each chromosome.

When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed during anaphase I, separating and segregating independently of each other. This is called independent assortment . It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes.

In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be? This is likely to be a matter of chance. It is obviously another source of genetic variation in offspring. This is known as random fertilization.



All of these mechanisms working together result in an amazing amount of potential variation. Each human couple, for example, has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion genetically unique children. No wonder we are all different!





Crossing-Over


As mentioned above, crossing-over occurs during prophase I, and it is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Recall during prophase I, homologous chromosomes line up in pairs, gene-for-gene down their entire length, forming a configuration with four chromatids, known as a tetrad . The process of pairing the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis . During synapsis, non-sister chromatids may cross-over at points called chiasmata. Within a chiasma , the genetic material from two non-sister chromatids actually intertwine around each other, and some material from non-sister chromatids switch chromosomes, that is, the material breaks off and reattaches at the same position on the homologous chromosome ( Figure below ). This exchange of genetic material can happen many times within the same pair of homologous chromosomes, creating unique combinations of alleles. This process is also known as homologous recombination .



Figure 7.29

During crossing-over, segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Notice how this can result in an allele (A) on one chromosome being moved to the other chromosome. The four chromatids compose the tetrad, with a chiasma at the point of exchange.





Independent Assortment and Random Fertilization


In humans, there are over 8 million configurations in which the chromosomes can line up during metaphase I of meiosis. It is the specific processes of meiosis, resulting in four unique haploid cells, that result in these many combinations. This independent assortment, in which the chromosome inherited from either the father or mother can sort into any gamete, produces the potential for tremendous genetic variation. This process underlies the chromosomal basis of inheritance. Gregor Mendel's findings and laws will be discussed in the Inheritance concepts, but essentially, his findings led to the development of two laws of inheritance: the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment. The Law of Segregation states that when any individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate so that each gamete receives only one copy (one allele) of that gene. The Law of Independent Assortment states that separate genes for separate traits are passed independently of one another from parents to offspring.

Together with random fertilization, more possibilities for genetic variation exist between any two people than the number of individuals alive today. Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male. In humans, over 8 million (2 23 ) chromosome combinations exist in the production of gametes in both the male and female. Essentially, when the homologous pairs of chromosomes line up during metaphase I and then are separated at anaphase I, there are (2 23 ) possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes. During random fertilization, a sperm cell, with over 8 million possible chromosome combinations, fertilizes an egg cell, which also has over 8 million possible chromosome combinations. Together, there are over 64 trillion unique combinations, not counting the additional variation produced by crossing-over during prophase I. In other words, each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations!





Mitosis vs. Meiosis


Mitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division, with dramatically different products. Mitosis begins with a diploid somatic cell and ends with two genetically identical diploid cells. Meiosis begins with a diploid cell and produces four haploid genetically unique cells that form gametes.

See How Cells Divide: Mitosis vs. Meiosis ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/divide.html ) for an animation comparing the two processes.



Figure 7.30

Gametogenesis - Advanced


Describe gametogenesis and identify the key differences between oogenesis and spermatogenesis.





What's the biggest cell on Earth?

The ostrich egg - unfertilized, of course. Yes, this egg, just like a human ovum, is just one cell. It is a gamete with a haploid number of chromosomes, formed through meiosis. The egg shell membrane encloses the nucleus containing the genetic material and the cytoplasm.





Gametogenesis


At the end of meiosis, haploid cells are produced. These cells need to further develop into mature gametes capable of fertilization, a process called gametogenesis ( Figure below ). Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis in organs called gonads. Gametogenesis differs between the sexes. In the male, the production of mature sperm cells, or spermatogenesis , results in four haploid gametes, whereas, in the female, the production of a mature egg cell, oogenesis , results in just one mature gamete.



Figure 7.31

Analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the development of the spermatids. Four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte, whereas only 1 mature ovum, or egg forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte. Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis. These polar bodies will not form mature gametes.



From gametogonium (plural, gametogonia ), male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis. A gametogonium is a germ cell that divides into gametocytes during gametogenesis. Male gametogonia are called spermatogonia , and female gametogonia are called oogonia . However, the following pattern is common for both oogonia and soermatogonia (chromosome numbers depict human chromosomes):

cell type ploidy chromosomes process

gametogonium diploid 46 mitosis

primary gametocyte diploid 46 meiosis 1

secondary gametocyte haploid 23 meiosis 2

gametid haploid 23

gamete haploid 23





Spermatogenesis


During spermatogenesis, spermatogonia (singular, spermatogonium ) form primary spermatocytes by mitosis. These cells go through the first cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes. These are haploid cells. Secondary spermatocytes then quickly complete the meiotic division to become spermatids , which are also haploid cells. The four haploid cells produced from meiosis develop a flagellum tail and compact head piece to become mature sperm cells, capable of swimming and fertilizing an egg. The compact head, which has lost most of its cytoplasm, is key in the formation of a streamlined shape. The middle piece of the sperm, connecting the head to the tail, contains many mitochondria, providing energy to the cell. The sperm cell essentially contributes only DNA to the zygote.



Figure 7.32

A human sperm is a tiny cell with a tail. A human egg is much larger. Both cells are mature haploid gametes that are capable of fertilization, shown in this photograph. Notice the sperm with a head piece, a flagella tail that propels the sperm, and a mid piece, which is mostly mitochondria, supplying ATP. Essentially, the head piece just contains the paternal genetic material.





Oogenesis


On the other hand, the egg provides the other half of the DNA, but also organelles, building blocks for compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids, and other necessary materials. The egg, being much larger than a sperm cell, contains almost all of the cytoplasm a developing embryo will have during its first few days of life. Therefore, oogenesis is a much more complicated process than spermatogenesis.

Oogenesis begins before birth and is not completed until after fertilization. Oogenesis begins when a diploid oogonia (singular, oogonium ), which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth, undergoes mitosis to form primary oocytes, also with the diploid number of chromosomes. It proceeds as a primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes. The one egg cell that results from meiosis I contains most of the cytoplasm, nutrients, and organelles. This unequal distribution of materials produces one large cell, and one cell with little more than DNA. This other cell, known as a polar body , eventually breaks down. A secondary oocyte then undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid ovum , only if it is fertilized by a sperm. Once again this unequal cell division will produce a large cell and a polar body. The large cell develops into the mature egg cell.



Figure 7.33

Maturation of the ovum. Notice only 1 mature ovum, or egg, forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte. Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis. These polar bodies will not form mature gametes. Conversely, four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte.



More on these gametes and their maturation will be presented in the Anatomy and Physiology concepts.





Vocabulary


gametogenesis : The further maturation of the haploid cells produced by meiosis into mature gametes capable of fertilization.



gametogonium (plural, gametogonia ): A germ cell that divides into gametocytes during gametogenesis.



oocyte : A female gamete or germ cell involved in reproduction; an immature ovum, or egg cell.



oogenesis : The production of a mature egg cell, which results in just one mature ovum, or egg cell.

Sexual Life Cycles - Advanced


Distinguish between the three types of sexual life cycles.





Young to old. A life cycle?

Not in the biological sense. Life cycles refer to the amount of DNA present at a specific stage or time in the life of an organism. Is there a haploid or diploid amount of DNA? That is the key question.





Sexual Life Cycles


Eukaryotes have three different versions of the sexual life cycle : a haploid life cycle, a diploid life cycle, and a life cycle known as the alternation of generations ( Figure below ). A life cycle is the span in the life of an organism from one generation to the next. All species that reproduce sexually follow a basic pattern, alternating between haploid and diploid chromosome numbers. The sexual life cycle depends on when meiosis occurs and the type of cell that undergoes meiosis.



Figure 7.34

Sexual Life Cycles.





Haploid Life Cycles


The haploid life cycle is the simplest life cycle. Organisms with this life cycle, such as many protists and some fungi and algae, spend the majority of their life cycle as a haploid cell. In fact, the zygote is the only diploid cell. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid cells, which grow into haploid multicellular organisms. These organisms produce gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse through a process called syngamy to produce diploid zygotes which undergo meiosis, continuing the life cycle.





Diploid Life Cycles


Organisms that have a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults. All diploid adults inherit half of their DNA from each parent. When they are ready to reproduce, diploid reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes. These gametes then fuse through fertilization and produce a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G 1 of the cell cycle. Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated. Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells. Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues. This is the life cycle of humans.





Alternation of Generations


Plants, algae, and some protists have a life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases, known as alternation of generations . In plants, the life cycle alternates between the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte . Spore forming cells in the diploid sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce spores , a haploid reproductive cell. Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with another cell. The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid gametophyte, which produce gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse, producing a diploid zygote, which grow into the diploid sporophyte.





Vocabulary


alternation of generations : A life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases.



diploid life cycle : Life cycle with the majority of time spent as diploid adults.



gametophyte : The gamete-producing phase in the alternation of generations life cycle; a haploid structure which produces gametes by mitosis.



haploid life cycle : Life cycle with the majority of time spent as haploid organisms.



life cycle : Series of stages a sexually reproducing organism goes through from one generation to the next; measured in terms of the quantity of DNA present;



spore : A haploid reproductive cell; found in plants, algae and some protists; can fully develop without fusing with another cell.



sporophyte : The spore-producing phase in the alternation of generations life cycle; a diploid structure which produces spores by meiosis.



syngamy : The fusion of gametes resulting in the formation of a zygote.





Summary


A life cycle is the sequence of stages an organisms goes through from one generation to the next.

Organisms that reproduce sexually can have different types of life cycles, such as haploid or diploid life cycles.

Inheritance - Advanced


Introduction




isn't this your typical everyday garden pea plant?

Yes, it is. But, in terms of biology, it is so much more. These plants, which have nice purple flowers, are not just pretty to look at. Plants like these led to a huge leap forward in biology. The plants are common garden peas, and they were studied in the mid-1800s by an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel. With his careful experiments, Mendel uncovered the secrets of heredity, or how parents pass characteristics to their offspring.

You may not care much about heredity in pea plants, but you probably care about your own heredity. Mendel's discoveries apply to you as well as to peas—and to all other living things that reproduce sexually. In these concepts you will read about Mendel's experiments and the secrets of heredity that he discovered.





Mendel - Advanced


Identify who Gregor Mendel was.

Describe how Mendel’s study of science and math was important to his success in research.





Why is heredity so important?

Genetics - the study of inheritance. Inheritance - the passing of traits from parents to offspring. How are these traits "passed"? Through DNA - the genetic material. And it all started with an Austrian Monk named Gregor Mendel and his vegetable garden.





Gregor Mendel: Teacher and Scientist


"My scientific studies have afforded me great gratification; and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges the results of my work." Quote attributed to Gregor Mendel.

For thousands of years, humans have understood that characteristics such as eye color, hair color, or even flower color are passed from one generation to the next. The passing of characteristics from parent to offspring is called heredity . Humans have long been interested in understanding heredity. Many hereditary mechanisms were developed by scholars but were not properly tested or quantified. The scientific study of genetics did not begin until the late 19 th century. In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance. Keep in mind that while we know about DNA and its role as the genetic material, Mendel did not know of the existence of DNA. Nor did he understand the concept of the chromosome or the process of meiosis, and yet, he was still able to correctly describe basic inheritance patterns.

Gregor Johann Mendel was an Augustinian monk, a teacher, and a scientist ( Figure below ). He is often called the "father of modern genetics" for his study of the inheritance of traits in pea plants. Mendel showed that the inheritance of traits follows particular laws, which were later named after him. The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20 th century. The rediscovery of his work led the foundation for the era of modern genetics , the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms.



Figure 8.1

Gregor Johann Mendel “The Father of Modern Genetics.” 1822-1884.



Johann Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents’ farm in an area of Austria that is now in the Czech Republic. He overcame financial hardship and ill health to excel in school. In 1843 he entered the Augustinian Abbey in Brünn (now Brno, Czech Republic.) Upon entering monastic life, he took the name Gregor. While at the monastery, Mendel also attended lectures on the growing of fruit and agriculture at the Brünn Philosophical Institute. In 1849 he accepted a teaching job, but a year later he failed the state teaching examination. One of his examiners recommended that he be sent to university for further studies. In 1851 he was sent to the University of Vienna to study natural science and mathematics. Mendel’s time at Vienna was very important in his development as a scientist. His professors encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use mathematics to help explain observations of natural events, which he did. In fact, it was the use of math in his analysis that made his conclusions much more convincing.





Mendel's Pea Plants


In 1853 and 1854, Mendel published two papers on crop damage by insects. However, he is best known for his later studies of the pea plant Pisum sativum . Mendel was inspired by both his professors at university and his colleagues at the monastery to study variation in plants. He had carried out artificial fertilization on plants many times in order to grow a plant with a new color or seed shape. Artificial fertilization is the process of transferring pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part of another flower. Artificial fertilization is done in order to have seeds that will grow into plants that have a desired trait, such as yellow flowers. Mendel returned to Brünn in 1854 as a natural history and physics teacher. A brief biography of Mendel can be found at http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Gregor_Mendel.php .

Blending Theory of Inheritance


During Mendel’s time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular. This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the characteristics of their parents. Mendel noticed plants in his own garden that weren’t a blend of the parents. For example, a tall plant and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not medium in height. Observations such as these led Mendel to question the blending theory. He wondered if there was a different underlying principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited. He decided to experiment with pea plants to find out. In fact, Mendel experimented with almost 29,000 pea plants over the next several years! At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea plants: http://www.dnalc.org/view/16170-Animation-3-Gene-s-don-t-blend-.html .

Explain how Mendel was able to control pollination of the pea plants.





What's so special about this plant?

The pea plant Pisum sativum has purple and white flowers. These flowered plants are not just pretty to look at. These plants led Gregor Mendel to unlock the secrets of heredity, beginning the field of genetics. For his efforts, Mendel is widely known as the Father of Genetics, even though he knew nothing of the genetic material, DNA. The laws he developed apply to all sexually reproducing life, and are the basis for beginning to understand many human diseases.





Mendel and the Pea Plant


Prior to Mendel's studies, it was commonly believed that offspring were a "mix" of their parents (the blending theory of inheritance). For example, if a pea plant had one short parent and one tall parent, that pea plant would be of medium height. It was believed that the offspring would then pass on heritable units, or heritable factors , for medium sized offspring. (Today we know these heritable units are genes; however, Mendel did not know of the concept of a gene or of DNA.) Mendel noted that plants in the monastery gardens sometimes gave rise to plants that were not exactly like the parent plants, nor were they a “mix” of the parents. He also noted that certain traits reappeared after “disappearing” in an earlier generation. Mendel was interested in finding out if there was a predictable pattern to the inheritance of traits. Between 1856 and 1863 he grew and analyzed about 29,000 pea plants in the monastery garden. It was Mendel's knowledge and use of mathematics in his studies that allowed him to analyze his results like no one before him.

Mendel may have chosen to study peas and pea plants because they are fast-growing plants that are available in different varieties. For example, one variety of pea plant has white flowers, as shown in Figure below , while another variety has purple flowers. But no variety has a pinkish-blend of the purple and white; there is no "middle" color of flower in this particular species, P. sativum.



Figure 8.2

Pisum sativum, the pea plant species that Mendel studied.



Mendel chose to study seven characteristics of pea plants. A characteristic is a heritable feature, such as flower color. Each characteristic Mendel chose to study occurred in two contrasting traits. A trait is a heritable variant of a characteristic, such as purple or white flower color. Once again, no "blended" traits were observable. Figure below lists the seven characteristics Mendel studied and their two contrasting traits.



Figure 8.3

Mendel investigated seven different characteristics in pea plants. In this chart, cotyledons refer to the tiny leaves inside seeds. Axial pods are located along the stems. Terminal pods are located at the ends of the stems.





Pea Plant Pollination


In order to study these characteristics, Mendel needed to control the pollination of the pea plants through artificial fertilization . Pollination occurs when the pollen from the male reproductive part of a flower, called the anthers , is transferred to the female reproductive part of a flower, called the stigma . Pea plants are self-pollinating , which means the pollen from a flower on a single plant transfers to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. In order to avoid self-pollination, Mendel removed the anthers from the flowers on a plant. He then carefully transferred pollen from the anthers of another plant and using a small paintbrush, dusted the pollen onto the stigma of the flowers that lacked anthers. This process caused cross-pollination. The Figure below shows the location of the male and female parts of a flower. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen from one flower pollinates a flower on a different plant. In this way, Mendel controlled the characteristics that were passed onto the offspring. The product of cross-pollination is known as a hybrid. The ability to cross-pollinate pea plants allowed Mendel to study the offspring of two parents with different traits, such as a tall stem or a short stem.

Identify the traits that appeared in Mendel’s F 2 generation.





Peas. Some round and some wrinkled. Why?

That's what Mendel asked. He noticed peas were always round or wrinkled, but never anything else. Why? Seed shape was one of the traits Mendel studied in his first set of experiments. Through his analysis of these peas, analyzing seven characteristics, Mendel was able to develop two Laws of Inheritance. And he did this essentially through just two types of experiments.





Mendel’s First Experiment


Mendel began his studies by growing plants that were true-breeding for a particular trait. A true-breeding plant will always produce offspring with that trait when they self-pollinate. For example, a true-breeding plant with yellow seeds will always have offspring that have yellow seeds. To obtain these plants, Mendel allowed plants with just one trait, such as purple flowers or white flowers, to self-pollinate for many generations. He allowed this to continue until he was sure the offspring from those plants always had only just the one trait, in this case, either purple flowers or white flowers.

In his first experiment, Mendel cross-pollinated two true-breeding plants of contrasting traits, such as purple and white flowered plants. The true-breeding parent plants are referred to as the P generation (parental generation). The hybrid offspring of the P generation are called the F 1 generation (first filial generation). The hybrid offspring of the F 1 generation are called the F 2 generation (second filial generation).





Monohybrid Crosses


Mendel first worked with plants that differed in a single characteristic, such as flower color. A hybridization is a cross between two individuals that have different traits. A hybridization in which only one characteristic is examined is called a monohybrid cross . The offspring of such a cross are called monohybrids. Mendel noted that hybridizing true-breeding (P generation) plants gave rise to an F 1 generation that showed only one trait of a characteristic. For example, a true-breeding purple-flowering plant crossed with a true-breeding white-flowering plant always gave rise to purple-flowered hybrid plants. There were no white-flowered hybrids. Mendel wanted to know what happened to the white-flowers. If indeed a "heritable factor" for white-flower had disappeared, all future offspring of the hybrids would be purple-flowered - none would be white. To test this idea, Mendel let the F 1 generation plants self-pollinate and then planted the resulting seeds.



Figure 8.4

This diagram shows Mendel's first experiment with pea plants. Mendel started by crossing a true-breeding purple-flowering plant with a true-breeding white-flowering plant. The F1 generation contained all purple flowers. The F2 generation results from self-pollination of F1 plants, and contained 75% purple flowers and 25% white flowers.





Mendel’s Results


The F 2 generation plants that grew included white-flowered plants. Mendel noted the ratio of white flowered plants to purple-flowered plants was about 3:1. That is, for every three purple-flowered plants, there was one white flowered plant. The Figure below shows Mendel’s results for the characteristic of flower color.

Mendel carried out identical studies over three generations, (P, F 1 , and F 2 ), for the other six characteristics and found in each case that one trait “disappeared” in the F 1 generation, only to reappear in the F 2 generation. Mendel studied a large number of plants, as shown in the Table below . His use of statistics to demonstrate the repeated 3:1 ration of traits. Because of the repeatable nature of his findings, Mendel was confident that the ratios of different traits in the F 2 generation were representative. As shown in the table, Mendel called the trait that appeared in the F 2 75% of the time the dominant trait, and the trait that reappeared in the F 2 the recessive trait. See Some genes are dominant at http://www.dnaftb.org/4/animation.html for animation describing these findings.

Summary


Mendel’s use of mathematics in his pea plant studies was important to the confidence he had in his results.

Mendel carried out his first experiments with true-breeding plants and continued them over a span of three generations.

For each of the seven characteristics Mendel studied, he observed a similar ratio in the inheritance of dominant to recessive traits (3:1) in the F 2 generation.

Theory of Heredity - Advanced


Identify the actions of dominant alleles and recessive alleles for a trait.

Outline the Law of Segregation.





Do you look like your parents?

What about if you're a lion, or dog or pea plant? Do you look like your parents? You probably have some traits in common with each of your parents. Mendel's work provided the basis to understand the passing of traits from one generation to the next, which is heredity.





Mendel's Theory of Heredity


Based on his observations, Mendel developed four hypotheses. These hypotheses are known as Mendel’s theory of heredity. The hypotheses explain a simple form of inheritance in which two alleles of a gene are inherited to result in one of several traits in offspring. An allele in an alternative form of a gene, and a gene is a segment of DNA that has the information to encode a polypeptide or RNA molecule. Mendel called these "heritable factors" or "heritable units," as, during Mendel's time, DNA had not yet been identified. In modern terms, these hypotheses are:

There are different versions of genes . These different versions account for variations in characteristics. For example, there is a “yellow-pod” allele and a “green pod” allele of the gene for pod color. The blending inheritance hypothesis was discredited by Mendel’s allele hypothesis.

When two different alleles (heritable factors) are inherited together, one may be expressed, while the effect of the other may be “silenced.” In the case of pod color, the allele for green pods is always expressed and is dominant . The allele for yellow pods, which is not expressed, is recessive . For instance, if a plant inherits a “yellow-pod” allele and a “green pod” allele, it will have only green pods.

For each characteristic, an organism inherits two alleles (heritable factors), one from each parent. Mendel noted that offspring could inherit their traits from either parent. In the case of the expressed trait, it did not matter whether it was the male gamete or female gamete that supplied the gene.

When gametes are formed, the two alleles (heritable factors) of each gene are separated ( Figure below ). During meiosis, each male or female gamete receives one allele for a trait. When the male and female gametes are fused at fertilization, the resulting zygote contains two alleles of each gene. Keep in mind that Mendel developed this hypothesis without knowledge of meiosis.





Figure 8.6

Alleles on homologous chromosomes are randomly separated during gamete formation. Upon fertilization, the fusion of a male and female gametes results in new combinations of alleles in the resulting zygote.





Random Segregation of Alleles


Mendel summarized his findings in two laws: the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment. The Law of Segregation is based on his findings from his first set of experiments. Mendel stated that heritable factors are segregated during gamete formation. More precisely, this law states that a pair of alleles is separated, or segregated, during the formation of gametes. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly separated. Each resulting gamete has an equal probability or chance of receiving either of the two alleles. In other words, each gamete has only one allele for each gene.

See Genes are real things at http://www.dnaftb.org/6/animation.html for an animation of Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak-Seysenneg rediscovering Mendel's work in the year 1900.





Vocabulary


allele : An alternative form or different version of a gene.



dominant : The allele that is expressed when two separate alleles are inherited.



gene : A segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a single polypeptide.



Law of Segregation : Mendel’s first law of inheritance; states that the two factors (alleles) controlling a characteristic separate during gamete formation.



recessive : The allele that is expressed only in the absence of a dominant allele.





Summary


Mendel developed a theory that explained simple patterns of inheritance in which two alleles are inherited to result in one of several traits in offspring.

The law of segregation states that a pair of alleles is segregated during the formation of gametes and that each gamete has an equal chance of getting either one of the allele.





Review

What were Mendel's four hypotheses?

Summarize the law of segregation.





Mendel's Second Experiment - Advanced


Outline the Law of Independent Assortment.





Round and green, round and yellow, wrinkled and green, or wrinkled and yellow?

Can two traits be inherited together? Or are all traits inherited separately? Mendel asked these questions after his first round of experiments. And the answer to the first question is Yes. And the answer to the second question is also Yes. And Mendel's work began to explain how this is so.





Mendel’s Second Experiment


After Mendel's first set of experiments, Mendel wanted to see if the inheritance of characteristics were dependent, or were they independent events. Mendel asked if the segregation of the heritable factors (allele) for one characteristic (gene) had any effect of the segregation of the factors for another characteristic. For example, did the segregation of the flower color factors have any effect on the segregation of the seed shape factors? So Mendel performed crosses in which he followed the segregation of two genes. Mendel crossed pea plants that differed in two characteristics, such as seed color and shape. A dihybrid cross is a cross in which the inheritance of two characteristics are tracked at the same time. The offspring of such a cross are called dihybrids .

Once again Mendel began with a true-breeding P generation, but this time true-breeding for two characteristics. For example, he crossed pea plants that had yellow and round seeds with a plant that had green and wrinkled seeds. From Mendel's first experiments, yellow seed color is dominant to green seed color, and round seed shape is dominant to wrinkled. So for the F 1 generation, as before, the recessive traits disappeared, leaving Mendel with pea plants that had only round and yellow seeds. He then allowed the F 1 generation to self-pollinate, and examined the resulting F 2 generation. In the F 2 generation, the recessive traits reappeared, as did two novel combinations of traits: round green seeds, and wrinkled yellow seeds. From these results, Mendel concluded that characteristics were inherited independently of each other. That is the only way that the two new combinations of traits could have developed. From these findings, Mendel developed his second law, the Law of Independent Assortment.



Figure 8.7

This chart represents Mendel's second set of experiments. It shows the outcome of a cross between plants that differ in seed color (yellow or green) and seed form (shown here with a smooth round appearance or wrinkled appearance). The letters R, r, Y, and y represent genes for the characteristics Mendel was studying. Mendel didn’t know about genes, however. Genes would not be discovered until several decades later. This experiment demonstrates that in the F2 generation, 9/16 were round yellow seeds, 3/16 were wrinkled yellow seeds, 3/16 were round green seeds, and 1/16 were wrinkled green seeds.





Dihybrid Cross Summary

The Law of Independent Assortment


The Law of Independent Assortment , also known as or Mendel's Second Law, states that the inheritance of one trait will not affect the inheritance of another. Mendel concluded that different traits are inherited independently of each other, so that there is no relationship, for example, between seed color and seed shape. In modern terms, alleles of each gene separate independently during gamete formation.





Mendel's Laws Rediscovered


You might think that Mendel's discoveries would have made a big impact on science as soon as he made them. But you would be wrong. Why? Because Mendel's work was largely ignored. Mendel was far ahead of his time and working from a remote monastery. He had no reputation among the scientific community and limited previously published work.

Mendel’s work, titled Experiments in Plant Hybridization , was published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries, as well as 133 natural science associations. Mendel himself even sent carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading botanist of the day. The result - it was almost completely ignored. Von Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a better plant for studying heredity. Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent.

Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not long after Mendel had discovered his laws. Unfortunately, Darwin knew nothing of Mendel's discoveries and didn’t understand heredity. This made his arguments about evolution less convincing to many people. This is an example of the importance of the scientific inquiry mindset elimination of bias.

Even though he had repeated his studies using thousands of pea plants, and applied statistics to analyze his findings, Mendel's work was initially rejected as most biologists still believed in blending inheritance, and they did not understand his laws. It was not until after he died (January 6, 1884) that his work gained wide acceptance. By 1900, research into discontinuous inheritance - why do traits "disappear" in the F 1 generation? - led to independent duplication of Mendel's work by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns, and then the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Soon afterwards, other biologists started to establish genetics , the study of heredity, as a science.





Linked Genes on Chromosomes


We now know that the only alleles that are inherited independently are ones that are located far apart on a chromosome or that are on different chromosomes. There are many genes that are close together on a chromosome, and are packaged into the gametes together. Genes that are inherited in this way are called linked genes . Linked genes tend to be inherited together because they are located on the same chromosome; that are located at the same locus. Genes located for apart on the same chromosome, at different loci , may be inherited separately due to a possible genetic recombination event during prophase I of meiosis. Genetic linkage was first discovered by the British geneticists William Bateson and Reginald Punnett shortly after Mendel's laws were rediscovered.

Chromosome, gene, locus and alleles are all related. What is the different between a gene and a locus? Between a gene and an allele? Chromosomes are composed of genes located at specific loci. And genes have different alleles. If genes did not have different alleles, we would genetically be all the same. What does that mean?





Mendelian Theory and Molecular Genetics


Mendel was perhaps lucky in that the characteristics he chose to study in the pea plants had a relatively simple pattern of inheritance. These characteristics were determined by one gene for which there were exactly two alleles . One of these alleles was dominant and the other recessive. Had any of these characteristics been determined by more than one gene, he may not have been able to develop such amazing insight into inheritance. Unknowingly, he also analyzed characteristics that were not linked, that is, there were not inherited together; the inheritance of one trait did not effect the inheritance of any other trait. Keep in mind that Mendel did not know of DNA, chromosomes, genes, loci or alleles, and described his findings in terms of heritable factors. Nor did he know of meiosis or linked genes.

In many instances, the relationship between genes and inheritance is more complex than that which Mendel found. Nevertheless, geneticists have since found that Mendel’s findings can be applied to many organisms. For example, there are clear patterns of Mendelian inheritance in humans. These include the inheritance of normal characteristics and characteristics that occur less often. Easily observable Mendelian traits in humans include free ear lobes (in most people the ear lobes hang free (dominant), whereas the attached earlobe is recessive), hitchhiker's thumb (a straight thumb is dominant, while a bent thumb is recessive), widow's peak (a hairline with a distinct point in the middle of the forehead is dominant, while a straight hairline is recessive), dimpled chin (a cleft in the chin is dominant, whereas the absence of a cleft is recessive), and mid-digital hair (hair on any middle segments of the fingers is dominant). Of course, many severe human phenotypes are inherited in a Mendelian fashion including Phenylketonuria (PKU), cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and sickle-cell anemia. These are termed genetic disorders and will be discussed in additional concepts.





Dominant and Recessive Alleles


Mendel used letters to represent dominant and recessive factors. Likewise, geneticists now use letters to represent alleles. Capital letters refer to dominant alleles, and lowercase letters refer to recessive alleles. For example, the dominant allele for the trait of green pod color is indicated by G . The recessive trait of yellow pod color is indicated by g . A true-breeding plant for green pod color would have identical alleles GG in all its somatic cells. Likewise, a true-breeding plant for yellow pod color would have identical alleles gg in all of its somatic cells. During gamete formation, each gamete receives one copy of an allele. When fertilization occurs between these plants, the offspring receives two copies of the allele, one from each parent. In this case, all of the offspring would have two different alleles, Gg , one from each of its parents.

An organism that has an identical pair of alleles for a trait is called homozygous . The true-breeding parents GG and gg are homozygous for the pod color gene. Organisms that have two different alleles for a gene are called heterozygous ( Gg ). The offspring of the cross between the GG (homozygous dominant) and gg (homozygous recessive) plants are all heterozygous for the pod color gene. A homozygous individual is known as a homozygote, and a heterozygous individual is known as a heterozygote. Due to dominance and recessiveness of alleles, an organism’s traits do not always reveal its genetics. Therefore, geneticists distinguish between an organism’s genetic makeup, called its genotype , and its physical traits, called its phenotype . For example, the GG parent and the Gg offspring have the same phenotype (green pods) but different genotypes. An organism's genotype results in an organism's phenotype. For example, if your dog has black hair, you cannot easily tell its genotype (that would take some scientific analysis), but you can easily tell its phenotype.

What are the odds of landing on 7 again?

Not as high as inheriting an allele from a parent. Probability plays a big role in determining the chance of inheriting an allele from a parent. It is similar to tossing a coin. What's the chance of the coin landing on heads? What's the chance of inheriting the paternal allele? Or the maternal allele?





Probability and Genetics


A Mendelian trait is a trait that is controlled by a single gene that has two alleles. One of these alleles is dominant and the other is recessive. Many inheritable conditions in humans are passed to offspring in a simple Mendelian fashion. Medical professionals use Mendel’s laws to predict and understand the inheritance of certain traits in their patients. Also, farmers, animal breeders, and horticulturists who breed organisms can predict outcomes of crosses by understanding Mendelian inheritance and probability.



Figure 8.8

Tossing a Coin. Competitions often begin with the toss of a coin. Why is this a fair way to decide who goes first? If you choose heads, what is the chance that the toss will go your way? Is this similar to the probability of inheriting a particular allele?



The rules of probability that apply to tossing a coin or throwing a die also apply to the laws of segregation and independent assortment. Probability is the likelihood that a certain event will occur. It is expressed by comparing the number of events that occur to the total number of possible events. The equation is written as:

Probability = (number of times an event is expected to occur)/(total number of times an event could happen)

For example, in Mendel’s F 2 hybrid generation, the dominant trait of purple flower color appeared 705 times, and the recessive trait appeared 224 times. The dominant allele appeared 705 times out of a possible 929 times (705+224=929).

Probability = (705/929)

(705/929)= 0.76

Probability is normally expressed in a range between 0 and 1, but it can also be expressed as a percentage, fraction, or ratio. Expressed as a percentage, the probability that a plant of the F 2 generation will have purple flowers is 76%. Expressed as a fraction it is about ¾,and as a ratio it is roughly 3:1. The probability of the expression of the dominant allele for other characteristics can also be calculated the same way. In fact, Mendel found that all the other dominant “factors” had approximately a ¾ probability of being expressed in the F 2 hybrid generation. Review the Table below for the results for the other six characteristics.

Results of F1 Generation Crosses for Seven Characteristics in Characteristic Dominant Trait Recessive Trait F2 Generation (Dominant:Recessive) Ratio

Flower Color purple white 705:224 3.15:1

Flower Position on Stem axial terminal 651:207 3.14:1

Stem Length tall short 787:277 2.84:1

Pod Shape inflated constricted 882:299 2.95:1

Pod Color green yellow 428:152 2.82:1

Seed Shape round wrinkled or angular 5474:1850 2.96:1

Seed Color yellow green 6022:2001 3.01:1

The probability the recessive trait will appear in the F 2 hybrid generation is calculated in the same way.

Probability = (224/929)

(224/929) = 0.24

The probability of the recessive trait appearing in the F 2 generation is 24% or about ¼.

Results predicted by probability are most accurate when many trials are done. The best way to illustrate this idea is to toss a coin. Because a coin has two sides, every time you toss it the chance of tossing heads or tossing tails is 50%. The outcome of each separate toss is unaffected by any previous or future result. For example, imagine you tossed seven heads in a row. You would think that the next toss is more likely to be a tail, but the possibility of tossing another head is still 50%. If you tossed the coin a total of ten times, a total of seven heads and three tails, you would calculate the probability of tossing heads is 70%. The fact that you carried out only a small number of trials has affected your results. If Mendel had grown only 10 plants, he would have gotten different probabilities for the appearance of dominant and recessive traits. However, Mendel carried out many thousands of trials. He was therefore sure that his results were due to probability, and not to chance.





Probability and the Law of Segregation


Each coin toss is a separate event. Likewise, gamete formation is a separate event. The probability that a Pp heterozygote produces gametes with a P allele or a p allele is 50% for each gamete cell. In a fertilization involving two such plants (as in the F 1 generation self-pollination experiment), each pollen cell and each egg cell have a 50% chance of having the P or p allele.





Using Probability to Determine Alleles in Gametes


In Mendel's monohybrid cross, two heterozygous plants are crossed. Both plants produce gametes, all of which contain either a P or p allele for flower color. The likelihood that any particular gamete contains the allele for a white flower can be calculated. Because a gamete can only carry one out of two alleles, there are only two possible outcomes for a gamete. The probability that a gamete will carry the allele for white flower color is ½, 0.5, or 50%. The probability that a gamete will carry the allele for purple flower color is also ½.



Figure 8.9

Formation of gametes by meiosis. Paired alleles always separate and go to different gametes during meiosis.





Using Probability in a Heterozygous Cross


We can calculate the probability of any one of the offspring being heterozygous ( Pp ) or homozygous ( PP or pp ) for flower color. The probability of a plant inheriting the P or p allele from a heterozygous parent is ½. Multiply the probabilities of inheriting both alleles to find the probability that any one plant will be a pp homozygote.

½ × ½ = ¼ or 0.25

Only 25 %, or one outcome out of four, will result in a plant homozygous for white flower color ( pp ). The possibility that any one plant will be a PP homozygote is also 1/4. The heterozygous allele combination can happen twice ( Pp or pP ), so the two probabilities are added together ¼ + ¼ = 2/4, or ½. The probability that an offspring plant will be Pp heterozygous is ½.





Vocabulary


probability : The likelihood, or chance, that a certain event will occur.





Summary


Probability is the likelihood that a certain event will occur. It is expressed by comparing the number of events that actually occur to the total number of possible events. Probability can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or ratio.

Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to scientifically predict what would result. The ability to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring is important for many reasons. Predicting the possibility of a genetic cross is often aided by a Punnett square.





Predicting Genotypes with Punnett Squares


Mendel developed the law of segregation by following only a single characteristic, such as pod color, in his pea plants. Biologists use a diagram called a Punnett square , to help predict the probable inheritance of alleles in different crosses. The Punnett square is named after its developer, British geneticist Reginald C. Punnett.

In a monohybrid cross , such as the one in Figure below , the Punnett square shows every possible combination when combining one maternal (mother) allele with one paternal (father) allele. In this example, both organisms are heterozygous for flower color Bb (purple). Both plants produce gametes that contain both the B and b alleles. The probability of any single offspring showing the dominant trait is 3:1, or 75%. To develop a Punnett square, possible combinations of alleles in a gamete are placed on the top and left side of a square. For a monohybrid cross ( Table below ), individual alleles are used, whereas for a dihybrid cross ( Table below ), pairs of alleles are used. A Punnett square for a monohybrid cross is divided into four squares, whereas a Punnett square for a dihybrid cross is divided into 16 squares. How many boxes would a Punnett square need if three traits were examined? The squares are filled in with the possible combinations of alleles formed when gametes combine, such as in a zygote. See Genetic inheritance follows rules at http://www.dnaftb.org/5/animation.html for an animation of Reginald Punnett discussing his work.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygotes, Bb. Do you know where each letter (allele) in all four cells comes from? Two pea plants, both heterozygous for flower color, are crossed.

Predicting Offspring Genotypes


In the cross shown in Figure above , you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the genotype BB , one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype bb , and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype Bb . These percents of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between two heterozygous parents. Of course, when just four offspring are produced, the actual percents of genotypes may vary by chance from the expected percents. However, if you considered hundreds of such crosses and thousands of offspring, you would get very close to the expected results—just like tossing a coin.





Predicting Offspring Phenotypes


You can predict the percents of phenotypes in the offspring of this cross from their genotypes. B is dominant to b , so offspring with either the BB or Bb genotype will have the purple-flower phenotype. Only offspring with the bb genotype will have the white-flower phenotype. Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers. These are the same percents that Mendel obtained in his first experiment. The Punnett square is visual representation of Mendelian inheritance.

What if you wanted more cows with zebra stripes?

Is it a new dominant or recessive trait? What is the genotype of the cow's parents? To determine the genotypes, a testcross could be done. Though with cows, this could take some time.





Testcross and Punnett Squares


If an individual has the dominant phenotype, is the genotype always known? Not necessarily as both a homozygous dominant and heterozygous genotype can result in the same dominant phenotype. So what would be done if it was necessary to know the genotype? A testcross can be used to determine the organism's genotype. In a testcross, the individual with the unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual ( Figure below ).

Consider the following example: Suppose you have a purple and white flower and purple color ( P ) is dominant to white ( p ). The white flower must be homozygous for the recessive allele, but the genotype of the purple flower is unknown. It could be either PP or Pp . A testcross will determine the organism's genotype. The unknown genotype can be determined by observing the phenotypes of the resulting offspring. If crossing the unknown dominant phenotype ( PP or Pp genotype) individual with the recessive phenotype individual produces only dominant phenotypes (no recessive), then the unknown individual is homozygous dominant. If any recessive phenotypic individuals result from the cross, then the unknown individual must carry the recessive allele, and have the heterozygous genotype.

In the example shown here, a testcross is done to determine the genotype of a parental Agouti rat. Agouti ( A ) refers to a pattern of pigmentation in which individual hairs have several bands of light and dark pigment with black tips, and is the common color of the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus . Agouti is the dominant phenotype, and in this example, has the genotypes AA or Aa. White fur color is the recessive phenotype, with a aa genotype. If rats with white fur result from the parental cross, then both parents must carry the recessive allele, and the unknown parent must have an Aa genotype.



Figure 8.11

A testcross helps reveal the genotype of an organism when that organism shows the dominant trait, such as agouti coat color in rats. Such an organism could be homozygous dominant or heterozygous.





Determining Missing Genotypes


A Punnett square can also be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross. Suppose you have a parent plant with purple flowers and a parent plant with white flowers. Because the b allele is recessive, you know that the white-flowered parent must have the genotype bb . The purple-flowered parent, on the other hand, could have either the BB or the Bb genotype. The Punnett square in Figure below shows this cross. The question marks (?) in the chart could be either B or b alleles.



Figure 8.12

Punnett Square: Cross Between White-Flowered and Purple-Flowered Pea Plants. This Punnett square shows a cross between a white-flowered pea plant and a purple-flowered pea plant. Can you fill in the missing alleles? What do you need to know about the offspring to complete their genotypes?



Can you tell what the genotype of the purple-flowered parent is from the information in the Punnett square? No; you also need to know the genotypes of the offspring in row 2. What if you found out that two of the four offspring have white flowers? Now you know that the offspring in the second row must have the bb genotype. One of their b alleles obviously comes from the white-flowered ( bb ) parent, because that’s the only allele this parent has. The other b allele must come from the purple-flowered parent. Therefore, the parent with purple flowers must have the genotype Bb .

Dihybrid Crosses and Punnett Squares


Punnett Squares and Dihybrid Crosses


The Punnett square also allows the determination of genotypes and phenotypes from dihybrid crosses . However, this process works only if the genes are independent of each other, that is, they are not linked, and they segregate independently of each other during meiosis. In other words, the inheritance of an allele of one gene does not effect the inheritance of an allele from another gene. This is usually true for alleles of genes on different chromosomes, or genes that are not close together on the same chromosome. Genes that are close together on the same chromosome may not segregate independently of each other during meiosis, and are known as linked genes.

Dihybrid crosses are more complicated than monohybrid crosses because more combinations of alleles are possible. For example, tracking the inheritance of pod color and pod form in a Punnett square requires that we track four alleles. R is the dominant allele for green pod color and r is the recessive allele for yellow pods. Y is the dominant allele for flat pod form and y is the recessive allele for constricted pod form.

If two pea plants are crossed, and one is true-breeding for green flat pods ( RRYY ), the other is true-breeding for yellow constricted pods ( rryy ), then all of the F 1 generation will be heterozygous for both traits ( RrYy ). Figure below , shows the dihybrid cross of the dihybrid P generation and the F 1 generation. Those F 1 individuals will have gametes with four possible combinations of alleles: RY, Ry, rY and ry. If these individuals are allowed to self-pollinate, then 16 combinations of alleles are possible upon combination of gametes.

According to Mendel's Second Law, the Law of Independent Assortment , the inheritance of one trait will not affect the inheritance of another, meaning that alleles of each gene separate independently during gamete formation. If the genes are linked, then alleles will sort as a pair and not individually. Proper determination of genotypic and phenotypic ratios will not be possible without additional genetic analysis. This is the basis of linkage maps and determining how close genes are to each other, and will be discussed in additional concepts.





Heterozygous Dihybrid Cross


The phenotypes of the offspring from a heterozygous dihybrid cross with two independent traits, such as the RrYy x RrYy example, show a 9:3:3:1 ratio. In a cross involving pea plants heterozygous for green flat pods ( GgFf ), 9/16 plants have green flat pods, 3/16 have green constricted pods, 3/16 have yellow flat pods, and 1/16 have yellow constricted pods. Notice that two of these combinations are the original parental phenotypes (green flat pods, and yellow constricted pods) and two are new phenotypic combinations (green constricted pods, and yellow flat pods). What would be the suggestion if the 9:3:3:1 ratio was not obtained?

Mendelian Inheritance in Humans - Advanced


Examine how a pedigree is used in the study of human inheritance.





Why is understanding your family's genetic history important?

If a genetic disorder runs throughout your family, understanding this history can help evaluate your and other's genetic risks associated with that phenotype. This can be especially important as you decide to have your own children.





Mendelian Inheritance in Humans


Inheritance in humans is not as straight-forward as that in the pea plant. Though some traits are inherited in simple Mendelian fashion, many are not. To analyze simple Mendelian inheritance a pedigree is often utilized. This is especially helpful in tracking the inheritance of a specific trait, characteristic or disorder (or allele) through a family.





Pedigrees


A pedigree is a chart which shows the inheritance of a trait over several generations. A pedigree is commonly created for families, as it can be used to outlines the inheritance patterns of familial traits or genetic disorders. It can be used to demonstrate autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, or sex-linked inheritance. Figure below shows a pedigree depicting recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations. The trait is thought to be recessive as for the two individuals with the trait, neither has a parent who also has the trait. Geneticists may also be able to determine whether individuals with the trait in question are heterozygous or homozygous for the allele associated with the trait. When alleles are added to the pedigree shown ( A or a ), recessive inheritance in conformed.



Figure 8.14

In a pedigree, squares symbolize males, and circles represent females. A horizontal line joining a male and female indicates that the couple had offspring. Vertical lines indicate offspring which are listed left to right, in order of birth. Shading of the circle or square indicates an individual who has the trait being traced. The inheritance of the recessive trait is being traced. A is the dominant allele and a is recessive. An "affected" individual has the trait or characteristic (or disease) in question.



Pedigree analysis is discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbIHjsn5cHo (9:13).





Sex-linked or Autosomal?


A sex chromosome is a chromosome that determines the sex of an organism. Humans have two sex chromosomes, X and Y . Females have two X chromosomes ( XX ), and males have one X and one Y chromosome ( XY ). An autosome is any chromosome other than a sex chromosome. If a trait is autosomal it will affect males and females equally.

A sex-linked trait is a trait whose allele is found on a sex chromosome. The human X chromosome is significantly larger than the Y chromosome; there are many more genes located on the X chromosome than there are on the Y chromosome. As a result there are many more X-linked traits than there are Y-linked traits. Most sex-linked traits are recessive. Because males carry only one X chromosome, if they inherit a recessive sex-linked gene they will show a sex-linked condition; there is no dominant allele to offset the recessive allele.

Because of the recessive nature of most sex-linked traits, a female who shows a sex-linked condition would have to have two copies of the sex-linked allele, one on each of her X chromosomes. Figure below shows how red-green colorblindness, a sex-linked disorder, is passed from parent to offspring.



Figure 8.15

An X-linked disorder such as red-green colorblindness is normally passed onto the son of a carrier mother. Usually, females are unaffected as they have a second, normal copy of the allele on the second X chromosome. However, if a female inherits two defective copies of the allele, she will be colorblind. Therefore, every son of a colorblind woman will be colorblind.





Dominant or Recessive?


If the trait is autosomal dominant, every person with the trait will have a parent with the trait. If the trait is recessive, a person with the trait may have one, both or neither parent with the trait. An example of an autosomal dominant disorder in humans is Huntington’s disease (HD). Huntington’s disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. It has no obvious effect on phenotype until the person is aged 35 to 45 years old, so often these individuals have children. The disease is non-curable and, eventually, fatal. Every child born to a person who develops HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the defective allele from the parent.





Heterozygous or Homozygous?


If a person is homozygous or heterozygous for the dominant allele of a trait, they will have that trait. If the person is heterozygous for a recessive allele of the trait, they will not show the trait. A person who is heterozygous for a recessive allele of a trait is called a carrier . Only people who are homozygous for a recessive allele of a trait will have the trait.

Non-Mendelian Inheritance - Advanced


Describe how codominance does not follow Mendelian Inheritance.

Describe how incomplete dominance does not follow Mendelian Inheritance.

Identify examples of polygenic traits in humans.





Green, blue, brown, black, hazel, violet, or grey. What color are your eyes?

Of course human eyes do not come in multi-color, but they do come in many colors. How do eyes come in so many colors? Are there more than two alleles? Is there more than one gene? That brings us to complex inheritance patterns, known as non-Mendelian inheritance. Many times inheritance is more complicated than the simple patterns observed by Mendel.





Non-Mendelian Modes of Inheritance


The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely as simple as the examples Mendel studied. Each characteristic he studied had two alleles, one of which was completely dominant and the other completely recessive, resulting in only two phenotypes. Geneticists now know that alleles can be codominant, or incompletely dominant, and that there are usually more than two alleles for a gene in a population. Complicating issues further, some phenotypes are controlled by more than one gene.





Codominance


What happens when there are two alleles in a heterozygote and neither allele is completely dominant nor completely recessive? Can both traits appear in the phenotype? Essentially, yes they can. Can there be two dominant alleles for the same gene? Codominance occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous offspring. For example, roan shorthorn cattle have codominant genes for hair color. The coat has both red and white hairs; not pink hairs, but red AND white hairs. The letter R indicates red hair color, and R’ white hair color. In cases of codominance, the genotype of the organism can be determined from its phenotype. The heifer in Figure below shows both coat colors and therefore is RR’ heterozygous for coat color. The flower in Figure below also has two codominant alleles; it has red and white petals, not pink petals. Both colors appear in the phenotype.



Figure 8.16

(left) The roan coat of this cow is made up of red and white hairs. Both the red and white hair alleles are codominant. Therefore cattle with a roan coat are heterozygous for coat color ( RR’ ). (right) The flower has red and white petals because of codominance of red-petal and white-petal alleles.





Incomplete Dominance


But what if there were pink petals as opposed to red and white petals? Which allele would be dominant? Both? Neither?

Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele does not occur. For example, when red snapdragons ( C R C R ) are crossed with white snapdragons ( C W C W ), the F 1 hybrids are all pink hetrozygotes for flower color ( C R C W ). The pink color is an intermediate between the two parent colors ( Figure below ). When two F 1 ( C R C W ) hybrids are crossed they will produce red, pink, and white flowers. The genotype of an organism with incomplete dominance can be determined from its phenotype ( Table below ).



Figure 8.17

Snapdragons show incomplete dominance in the traits for flower color. The pink snapdragon has pink petals because of incomplete dominance of a red-petal allele and a recessive white-petal allele.



Red Flower × White Flower allele (phenotype) C W (white) C W (white)

C R (red) C R C W (pink) C R C W (pink)

C R (red) C R C W (pink) C R C W (pink)





Complex Forms of Heredity


Traits that are affected by more than one gene are called polygenic traits . The genes that affect a polygenic trait may be closely linked on a chromosome, unlinked on a chromosome, or on different chromosomes. Polygenic traits are often difficult for geneticists to track because the polygenic trait may have many alleles. Also, independent assortment ensures the genes combine differently in gametes. Therefore, many different intermediate phenotypes exist in offspring. Eye color ( Figure below ), and skin color are examples of polygenic traits in humans.



Figure 8.18

Eye color and skin color are examples of polygenic traits; they are influenced by more than one gene.



When three or more alleles determine a trait, the trait is said to have multiple alleles . The human ABO blood group is controlled by a single gene with three alleles: the dominant I A and I B , and the recessive i allele. The gene encodes an enzyme that affects carbohydrates that are found on the surface of the red blood cell. A and B refer to two carbohydrates found on the surface of red blood cells. There is not an O carbohydrate. Type O red blood cells do not have either type A or B carbohydrates on their surface.

As the alleles I A and I B are dominant over i , a person who is homozygous recessive ( ii ) will not have type A or type B blood, but will have type O blood. Homozygous dominant I A I A or heterozygous I A i have type A blood, and homozygous dominant I B I B or heterozygous I B i have type B blood. I A I B individuals have type AB blood, because the A and B alleles are codominant. Type A and type B parents can have a type AB child. Type A and a type B parent can also have a child with Type O blood, if they are both heterozygous ( I B i , I A i ). The Table below shows how the different combinations of the blood group alleles can produce the four blood groups, A, AB, B, and O.

Bloodtype as Determined by Multiple Alleles I A I B i

I A I A I A Type A I A I B Type AB I A i Type A

I B I A I B Type AB I B I B Type B I B i Type B

i iI A Type A iI B Type B ii Type O





Vocabulary


ABO blood group : The most well known and medically important blood types; characteristic of all humans and many other primates; consists of four principal types: A, B, AB, and O.



codominance : Occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous individual.



incomplete dominance : Occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele is not present.



multiple alleles : When three or more alleles determine a trait, such as with the human ABO blood group.



polygenic trait : Traits that are due to the actions of more than one gene; often also involves interactions with the environment.





Summary


The Mendelian pattern of inheritance and expression does not apply to all traits.

Codominant traits, incompletely dominant traits, and polygenic traits do not follow simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Their inheritance patterns are more complex.

Effect of Environment on Genetics - Advanced


Outline how heredity and environment can interact to affect phenotype.





What do these twins have in common?

Almost all their DNA. In fact, all their nuclear DNA. Some of their mitochondrial DNA may have slight variations. So that would mean that genetic studies involving twins can be potentially very rewarding.





Effects of Environment on Phenotype


Genes play an important part in influencing phenotype, but genes are not the only influence. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and availability of nutrients can affect phenotypes. For example, temperature affects coat color in Siamese cats.



Figure 8.19

The dark “points” on this Siamese cat are caused by a gene that codes for a temperature-sensitive enzyme. The enzyme, which causes a darkening of the cat’s fur, is active only in the cooler parts of the body such as the tail, feet, ears, and area around the nose.



The pointed pattern is a form of partial albinism, which results from a mutation in an enzyme that is involved in melanin production. The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures. However, it is active in cooler areas of the skin. This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, such as the lower limbs and the face, as shown in Figure above . The cat’s face is cooled by the passage of air through the nose. Generally adult Siamese cats living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cooler climates.

Height in humans is a complex phenotype influenced by many genes, but it is also influenced by nutrition. A person who eats a diet poor in nutrients will not grow as tall as they would have had they eaten a more nutritious diet.





Environmental Trigger


Does everyone who smokes develop lung cancer? No, of course not. Is it possible to get lung cancer without smoking? Sadly, yes it is. That's not to say there is no relationship between the two: smoking is still the leading cause of lung cancer. But it does suggest that a person's genetic background has a role in this process. Apart form true single gene disorders, environmental factors, or environmental triggers , may determine the development of disease in individuals genetically predisposed to a particular condition. Environmental triggers may include stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Many cancers are thought to have an environmental component. It has been suggested that environmental factors play a role in autism as well. Asthma is obviously triggered under certain environmental conditions.





Twin Studies


The classical twin design compares the similarity of identical and fraternal twins.

Scientists often study the effects of environment on phenotype by studying identical twins. Identical twins have the same genes, so phenotypic differences between twins often have an environmental cause. Twin studies help understand the relative importance of environmental and genetic influences on individual traits and behaviors. Twins are a valuable source of information concerning the relationship between genes and environment. As monozygotic twins (identical) share their nuclear DNA, their polymorphisms , the nucleotide differences that make their DNA unique, are common to the two individuals. This means that any phenotypic variation, such as in height, intelligence, or any other measurable trait, is due to the environment. What is different about the experiences of the twins? What unique experiences might one twin have that the other twin did not have? By comparing phenotypes of hundreds of twins, researchers can understand the roles of genetics, shared environment and unique experiences in the formation and development of specific traits.

Dizygotic twins (fraternal or non-identical) share only about half of their polymorphisms. These twins are helpful to study as they tend to share many aspects of their environment. As they are born in the same place, usually within a few minutes of each other, they share many environmental conditions. They had the same in utero environment, they usually have a similar or the same parenting style during their childhood, and a similar or the same education. Similarities during childhood usually occur with wealth, culture, and their community.

Modern twin studies have shown that almost all human traits are at least partly influenced by genetic differences. Some characteristics, such as height, show a strong genetic influence, while other characteristics have an intermediate level of genetic influence, such as with intelligence. Some characteristics have a much more complex genetic relationship, with evidence for different genes affecting different aspects of the trait. Autism, with its wide spectrum of severity, is such an example.



Figure 8.20

Autism has a wide phenotypic spectrum of disability. Twin studies have been instrumental in demonstrating an environmental component in autism.





Vocabulary


dizygotic twins : Fraternal or non-identical twins; from two zygotes.



environmental triggers : Any factor, abiotic or biotic, that influences living organisms.



monozygotic twins : Identical twins; from one zygote.



polymorphism : Occurs when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species; may be a genetic polymorphism, due to differences in the DNA sequence.



twin study : Studies involving twins.





Summary


An organism’s phenotype can be influenced by environmental conditions.

Environmental triggers play a role in the development of disease in individuals genetically predisposed to that disease.

Twin studies help scientists understand the relative importance of environmental and genetic influences on individual traits and behaviors.

Human Genetics - Advanced


Define and describe human genetics.





What is meant by human genetics ?

Understanding the inheritance of DNA and genes. Understanding how this DNA makes a normal, healthy individual, and how this DNA may result in a disease phenotype. And understanding how to treat those phenotypes. In other words, The genetics of us. That's a tremendous endeavor. And we may never understand all there is to know about human genetics.





Human Genetics


Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on heredity. The basics of heredity are similar for all organisms that reproduce sexually: the offspring receive one set of genetic material from one parent and the other set from the other parent. But are there aspects of genetics that are specific for humans? Let’s find out.

Human genetics is the study of inheritance as it occurs in human beings. Human genetics addresses questions concerning human life. These include questions about human nature, human development and disease, and the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The general field of human genetics encompasses a variety of overlapping specific fields including: classical genetics, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, biochemical genetics, genomics, population genetics, developmental genetics, medical genetics and genetic counseling. All of these specific fields, however, analyze the inheritance of genes in humans. As the gene is the unit that determines a trait, it is also the unit that determines a disease phenotype.

A genetic disease is a phenotype due to a mutation in a gene or chromosome. Many of these mutations are present at conception and are therefore in every cell of the body. Mutant alleles may be inherited from one or both parents, resulting in a dominant or recessive hereditary disease. Currently, there are over 4,000 known genetic disorders, with many more phenotypes yet to be identified. Theoretically, every human gene, when disrupted due to a mutation, could result in at least one disease-type phenotype, including prenatal lethal phenotypes. Genetic diseases are typically diagnosed and treated by a geneticist , a medical doctor specializing in these disorders, many of which are extremely rare and difficult to diagnose. Individuals and families with genetic diseases, or suspected genetic diseases, are often counseled by genetic counselors , individuals trained in human genetics and counseling. To understand human genetic diseases, you first need to understand human chromosomes and genes.

Two of the most important human medical geneticists are Victor A. McKusick (1921–2008) and David L. Rimoin (1936-2012). Dr. McKusick is widely regarded as the '"Father of Medical Genetics." He was the original author and editor of Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) and its online version Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) , a database of heritable diseases and genes. In 1957, Dr. McKusick established a medical genetics clinic at Johns Hopkins University, thought to be one of the first two such clinics in the US at that time. Today there are over 100 such clinics throughout the US, and many more throughout the world, training thousands of individuals. Dr. McKusick also played a leading role in investigating whether Abraham Lincoln had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome.

Dr. Rimoin is considered by many to be the founder of the medical genetics clinical specialty. He was the founding president of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and a founding president of the American Board of Medical Genetics. He was a pioneer in the study of dwarfism. He developed a Tay-Sachs screening program and determined that diabetes is caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities. Both Drs. McKusick and Rimoin were experts and pioneers in the study of the clinical and genetic understanding of human skeletal disorders.

See Mendelian genetics cannot fully explain human health and behavior at http://www.dnaftb.org/14/animation.html for an interesting story of human genes.

The Human Genome - Advanced


What is the human genome?

Discuss the importance of characterizing the human genome.





All these ACGTs. What are they?

Over three billion of them from a human form the human genome - the human genetic material - all the information needed to encode a human being. It would take about 9.5 years to read out loud - without stopping - the more than three billion pairs of bases in one person's genome.





The Human Genome


What makes each one of us unique? You could argue that the environment plays a role, and it does to some extent. But most would agree that your parents have something to do with your uniqueness. In fact, it is our genes that make each one of us unique – or at least genetically unique. A gene is a segment of DNA that has the instructions to encode a protein or RNA molecule and give you a trait.

We all have the genes that make us human: the genes for skin and bones, eyes and ears, fingers and toes, and so on. However, we all have different skin colors, different bone sizes, different eye colors and different ear shapes. In fact, even though we have the same genes, the products of these genes work a little differently in most of us. And that is what makes us unique.

The human genome is the genome - all the DNA - of Homo sapiens . Humans have about 3.2 billion bases of information, divided into roughly 20,000 to 23,000 genes, which are spread among non-coding sequences of DNA and distributed among 24 distinct chromosomes (22 autosomes plus the X and Y sex chromosomes) ( Figure below ). These 24 chromosomes are arranged into 23 pairs: 22 pairs of autosomes, numbered 1-22, with chromosome 1 being the largest and chromosome 22 the smallest, and one pair of sex chromosomes. Females have a pair of X chromosomes, while males have an X and a Y chromosome.

The genome is all of the hereditary information encoded in the DNA, including the genes and non-coding sequences. The Human Genome Project (see the DNA Technology: The Human Genome Project (Advanced) concept) has produced a reference sequence of the human genome. The human genome consists of protein-coding exons, associated introns and regulatory sequences, genes that encode other RNA molecules, and “junk” DNA, regions in which no function as yet been identified.



Figure 8.21

Human Genome, Chromosomes, and Genes. Each chromosome of the human genome contains many genes as well as noncoding intergenic (between genes) regions. Each pair of chromosomes is shown here in a different color. Notice that there are 23 pairs of chromosomes.





Satellite DNA and Transposons


The majority of the human genome is non-coding sequence. These sequences include regulatory sequences, and DNA with unknown functions. These sequences include tandem repeat elements known as satellite DNA , and transposons. Satellite DNA consists of very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA. The repeating units can be just a single base (a mono nucleotide repeat), two bases (a dinucleotide repeat), three bases (a trinucleotide repeat) or a much larger repeating unit. Some repeating units are several thousand base pairs long, and the total size of a satellite DNA segment can be several megabases without interruption.

Other tandem repeat elements include minisatellite and microsatellite DNA. Both of these are also known as which is also known as VNTRs , for variable number of tandem repeats. Their analysis is useful in genetics and biology research, forensic science, and DNA fingerprinting. Minisatellite DNA is a section of DNA that consists of a short segments of repeating units 10-60 bp long. These occur at more than 1,000 locations in the human genome. Microsatellite DNA has smaller repeating units. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms. STR analysis forms the basis of identification in forensic DNA analysis. 13 STRs are routinely analyzed from throughout the human genome as part of CODIS , the Combined DNA Index System database maintained by the FBI.



Figure 8.22

This diagram is an example of DNA fingerprinting. The colored bands represent segments of DNA, separated based on size. 10 individuals are tested for 6 STRs. Lanes 3 and 10 represent size ladders. Notice that the pattern of bands is unique for each individual.



DNA sequences that repeat a number of times are known as repetitive sequences or repetitive elements. For example the sequence CACACACACACACA would be a dinucleotide (2 base) repeat, or the sequence GATCGATCGATCGATCGATC would be a tetranucleotide (4 base) repeat. The genomic loci and length of certain types of repetitive sequences are highly variable from person to person, which is the basis of DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. Longer repetitive elements are also common in the human genome. Examples of repeat polymorphisms are described in Table below .

Repeat Polymorphisms (bp = base pair) POLYMORPHISM REPEATS

Mononucleotide repeats of one bp

Dinucleotide repeats of two bp sequences

Trinucleotide repeats of three bp sequences

Tetranucleotide repeats of four bp sequences

Microsatellite ; Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) short sequences of 100-200 bp, usually due to repeats of 1-6 bp sequences

Minisatellite sequences of 100-200 bp, usually due to short sequences of 10-60 bp repeats

VNTR : Variable Number of Tandem Repeat short nucleotide sequence ranging from 14 to 100 nucleotides long, organized into clusters of tandem repeats, usually repeated in the range of between 4 and 40 times per loci

Transposons include retrotransposons and transposable elements. A transposable element is a DNA sequence that can change its relative position (self-transpose) within the genome of a single cell. Transposable elements either "cut and paste" or "copy and paste" themselves to move around the genome. This does result in a change in the DNA sequence and by definition, is a mutation. Some of the transpositions can result in severe phenotype changes. Barbara McClintock's discovery of these "jumping genes" earned her the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Retrotransposons are a subclass of transposons. They are genetic elements that can amplify themselves in a genome.

See Some DNA can jump at http://www.dnaftb.org/32/animation.html to see Barbara McClintock speak about her work.





Variation


As stated above, even though we essentially all have the same genes, the gene products work a little different in all of us, making us unique. That is, the variation within the human genome results in the uniqueness of our species. In fact, genetically speaking, we are all about 99.9% identical. However, it is this 0.1% variation that results in our physical noticeable differences, as well as traumatic events such as illnesses or congenital deformities. These differences can also be used for societies benefits, such as through forensic DNA analysis. Most studies of this genetic variation focus on small differences, know as SNPs , or single nucleotide polymorphisms , which are substitutions in individual bases along a chromosome. For example, the single base change from the sequence GGATAACGTCA to GGAAAACGTCA would be a SNP. Although not occurring uniformly, in the human genome, it has been estimated that SNPs occur every 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 bases.





Mitochondrial DNA


Additionally, small mitochondrial DNA is found in human mitochondria and contributes to the genome. Human mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule, on average 16,569 nucleotides long and contains 37 genes. 100s to 1000s of these DNAs can be present in a single cell. Due to the cytoplasmic location of the mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA is strictly inherited form the mother. The structure of this DNA is similar to that of a bacteria, and is one piece of evidence supporting the Theory of Endosymbiosis.

Coiled bundles of DNA and proteins, containing hundreds or thousands of genes. What are these things?

Chromosomes. Usually people have 46 of them, 23 from each parent. These "X-shaped" structures ensure that each cell receives the proper amount of DNA during cell division. The DNA coils into these structures that makes proper separation during mitosis and meiosis possible.





Chromosomes and Genes


The human genome consists of 24 distinct chromosomes: 22 autosomal chromosomes plus the sex-determining X and Y chromosomes. A chromosome is a threadlike molecule of genes and other DNA located in the nucleus of a cell. Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. Human somatic cells have 23 chromosome pairs for a total of 46 chromosomes: two copies of the 22 autosomes (one from each parent), plus an X chromosome from the mother and either an X or Y chromosome from the father ( Figure below ).



Figure 8.23

The human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the nucleus of somatic cells. Each chromosome is composed of genes and other DNA wound around histones (proteins) into a tightly coiled molecule.





Figure 8.24

Human Chromosomes. Human chromosomes are shown here arranged by size. Chromosome 1 is the largest, and chromosome 22 is the smallest. All normal human cells (except gametes) have two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes per cell. Only one of each pair is shown here.





Figure 8.25

Human Chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Pairs 1-22 are autosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome.



There are an estimated 20,000-23,000 human protein-coding genes, but many more proteins. Most human genes have multiple eons (coding sequences) separated by much larger introns (non-coding sequences). Regulatory sequences controlling gene expression are associated with exon sequences. The introns are usually excised (removed) during post-transcriptional modification of the mRNA. Human cells make significant use of alternative splicing (see the Protein Synthesis concepts) to produce a number of different proteins from a single gene. So even though the human genome is surprisingly similar in size to the genomes of simpler organisms, the human proteome is thought to be much larger. A proteome is the complete set of proteins expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism.





Linkage


As stated above, our roughly 20,000+ genes are located on 24 distinct chromosomes. So many genes are located on the same chromosome. Chromosome 1 is the largest chromosome with approximately 246 million base pairs, whereas chromosome 21 and 22 are the smallest chromosomes, with just under 50 million base pairs each. See http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/faqs.shtml for additional information on each human chromosome.

Linkage refers to particular genetic loci , or alleles inherited together, suggesting that they are physically on the same chromosome, and located close together on that chromosome. Two or more loci that are on the same chromosome are physically connected and tend to segregate together during meiosis, unless a cross over event occurs between them. A crossing-over event during prophase I of meiosis is rare between loci that usually segregate together; these loci will usually be close together on the same chromosome. They are, therefore, said to be linked. Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are not linked; they sort independently (independent assortment) of each other during meiosis.

A gene is also said to be linked to a chromosome if it is physically located on that chromosome. For example, a gene (or loci) is said to be linked to the X-chromosome if it is physically located on the X-chromosome chromosome. The physical location of a gene is important when analyzing the inheritance patterns of phenotypes due to that gene. The inheritance patterns of phenotypes may be different if the gene is located on a sex chromosome or an autosome. This will be further discussed in additional Human Genetics concepts.





Linkage Maps


The frequency of recombination refers to the rate of crossing-over ( recombination ) events between two loci. This frequency can be used to estimate genetic distances between the two loci, and create a linkage map . In other words, the frequency can be used to estimate how close or how far apart the two loci are on the chromosome.

In the early 20 th century, Thomas Hunt Morgan, working with the fruit fly Drosophila Melanogaster , showed that genes can be linked. He showed that genes located on the same chromosome do not show independent assortment. He was able to demonstrated that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs. This led to the idea that the frequency of crossover events would indicate the distance separating genes on a chromosome. Morgan's student, Alfred Sturtevant, developed the first genetic map, also called a linkage map.

Sturtevant proposed that the greater the distance between linked genes, the greater the chance that non-sister chromatids would cross over in the region between the genes during meiosis. By determining the number of recombinants - offspring in which a cross-over event has occured - it is possible to determine the approximate distance between the genes. This distance is called a genetic map unit (m.u.), or a centimorgan , and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 products is a recombinant. So, a recombinant frequency of 1% (1 out of 100) is equivalent to 1 m.u. Loci with a recombinant frequency of 10% would be separated by 10 m.u. The recombination frequency will be 50% when two genes are widely separated on the same chromosome or are located on different chromosomes. This is the natural result of independent assortment. Linked genes have recombination frequencies less than 50%.

Thomas Hunt Morgan also demonstrated linkage to sex chromosomes in Drosophila. See Chromosomes carry genes at http://www.dnaftb.org/10/animation.html and Genes get shuffled when chromosomes exchange pieces at http://www.dnaftb.org/11/animation.html for two animations on the work of Morgan and Sturtevant.

Determining recombination frequencies between genes located on the same chromosome allows a linkage map to be developed. Linkage mapping is critical for identifying the location of genes that cause genetic diseases.

Others code for abnormal proteins that lead to genetic disorders. Which pair of genes would you expect to have a lower frequency of crossing-over: the genes that code for hemophilia A and G6PD deficiency, or the genes that code for protan and Xm?

Autosomal Traits - Advanced


Define autosome and autosomal trait.

Describe the inheritance of many physical characteristics.





How is DNA inherited?

In chromosomes. The DNA winds up numerous times to form the compact structure. 44 of your 46 chromosomes are autosomes. The other two determine your sex.





Autosomes


There are 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes in the human genome, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Sex chromosomes specify an organism's genetic sex. Humans can have two different sex chromosomes, one called X and the other Y. Normal females possess two X chromosomes and normal males one X and one Y. An autosome is any chromosome other than a sex chromosome. The Figure below shows a representation of the 24 different human chromosomes. Figure below shows a karyotype of the human genome. A karyotype depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities. Karyotypes use chromosomes from the metaphase stage of mitosis.



Figure 8.27

The 24 human chromosomes. The autosomes are numbered 1 - 22, based on size, with chromosome 1 being the largest. The X and Y sex chromosomes are shown in the box.





Figure 8.28

A karyotype of the human genome. Is this from a male or female?



The 22 autosomes are numbered based on size, with the largest chromosome labeled chromosome 1. These 22 chromosomes occur in homologous pairs in a normal diploid cell, with one of each pair inherited from each parent. The sex of an individual is determined by the sex chromosome within the male gamete. Females are homologous, XX, for the sex chromosomes, whereas males are heterozygous, XY. As all individuals inherit an X chromosome from their mother (females can only produce gametes with an X chromosome), it is the sex chromosome that they inherit from their father that determines their sex.

In terms of genetics, is the location of a gene or trait an important piece of information? Does it make a difference if the gene is located on a sex chromosome or an autosome? It might. Autosomal-linked traits are due to genes on the autosomes; sex-linked traits are due to genes located on the sex chromosomes.





Simple Dominant Heredity


What is the difference between a trait and a genetic disorder ? Could a disorder be considered a trait? We tend to think of traits as hair color or skin color and disorders as something that is bad for you. But in terms of genetics, a genetic disorder is a trait. Both may be due to your genes. Traits may be inherited in any of a number of ways: autosomal dominant or recessive, sex-linked inheritance, or a more complex pattern of inheritance.

How are traits due to genes on autosomes inherited? Autosomal traits due to the effects of one gene are usually inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern. That is, they can be either dominant or recessive. In humans, whereas many genetic disorders are inherited in a recessive manner, simple dominant inheritance accounts for many of a person’s physical characteristics, such as chin, earlobe, hairline and thumb shape. For example, having earlobes that are attached to the head is a recessive trait, whereas heterozygous and homozygous dominant individuals have freely hanging earlobes. If you have a cleft chin, a pointed frontal hairline (called a widow’s peak), or a hitchhiker’s thumb, you have inherited the dominant allele for each characteristic from at least one of your parents. Other dominant traits include the presence of hair on the middle section of your fingers, thick lips, and almond-shaped eyes. A widow's peak and hitchhiker’s thumb are displayed in Figure below , and earlobes are shown in Figure below .



Figure 8.29

Widow's peak and hitchhiker's thumb are dominant traits controlled by a single autosomal gene.





Figure 8.30

Having free-hanging earlobes is an autosomal dominant trait. This figure shows the trait and how it was inherited in a family over three generations. Shading indicates people who have the recessive form of the trait. Look at (or feel) your own earlobes. Which form of the trait do you have? Can you tell which genotype you have?





Vocabulary


autosome : Any chromosome other than a sex chromosome; chromosomes 1-22 in humans; unrelated to sex determination.



genetic disorder : A phenotype due to a mutation in a gene or chromosome; a genetic disease.



karyotype : Depicts, usually in a photograph, the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any large chromosomal abnormalities; usually taken during metaphase of mitosis.



sex chromosome : A chromosome that determines the sex of an organism; in humans, the X and Y chromosomes.



sex-linked trait : A trait whose allele is found on a sex chromosome.



trait : A heritable variant of a characteristic, such as purple or white flower color, or a widow's peak, or hitchhiker’s thumb.





Summary


There are 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes in the human genome, for a total of 46 chromosomes.

Sex chromosomes specify an organism's genetic sex. Humans have two different sex chromosomes, one called X and the other Y.

What number can you see?

Red-green colorblindness is a common inherited trait in humans. About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness, however, very few women are color blind. Why?





Sex-Linked Genes


Sex-linked genes are located on either the X or Y chromosome, though it more commonly refers to genes located on the X-chromosome. For that reason, the genetics of sex-linked (or X-linked ) diseases, disorders due to mutations in genes on the X-chromosome, results in a phenotype usually only seen in males. Can you explain why?

In humans, the Y chromosome spans 58 million bases and contains about 78 to 86 genes, which code for only 23 distinct proteins, making the Y chromosome one of the smallest chromosomes. The X chromosome, on the other hand, spans more than 153 million bases and represents about 5% of the total DNA in women's cells, 2.5% in men's cells. The X chromosome contains about 2,000 genes, however few, if any, have anything to do with sex determination. The Y chromosome is the sex-determining chromosome in humans and most other mammals. In mammals, it contains the gene SRY (sex-determining region Y), which encodes the testes-determining factor and triggers testis development, thus determining sex. It is the presence or absence of the Y chromosome that determines sex.

Sex-linked traits are discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ROhfKyxgCo .

X-Inactivation


Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in nearly all somatic cells. The inactive X chromosome is silenced by packaging into transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. This process, called X-inactivation , ensures that females, like males, have only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each cell. X-inactivation creates a Barr body, named after their discover, Murray Barr. The Barr body chromosome is generally considered to be inactive, however there are a small number of genes that remain active and are expressed. Inactivating one X chromosome prevents any detrimental effects of having twice as many X-linked genes as males. X-inactivation is a dosage compensation process.





XIST and TSIX


RNA plays an important role in X inactivation. Specifically, two noncoding, complementary RNAs, XIST and TSIX, initiate and control the inactivation process. XIST, or X-inactive specific transcript, was discovered due to its specific expression from inactive female X chromosomes. XIST has four unique properties:

The XIST gene produces a 17 kilo base (kb) RNA molecule; the RNA is not translated into a protein.

The XIST gene is only expressed in cells containing at least two X chromosomes; it is not normally expressed in XY cells. Cells with more than two X chromosomes have higher levels of XIST RNA, resulting in the inactivation of the additional X chromosomes. The result is that only one X chromosome per cell can remain active.

XIST RNA remains in the nucleus where it binds to the chromosome from which it is produced.

XIST RNA recruits additional silencing proteins to bind to the inactive X chromosome.



TSIX, on the other hand, does the opposite of XIST. Notice that TSIX is XIST backwards. TSIX is XIST's antisense partner. The TSIX gene is transcribed in the opposite direction of the XIST gene, and it is transcribed across the entire XIST gene. TSIX is a 40 kb noncoding RNA transcribed from the X chromosome that does not produce the XIST RNA.

There is an inverse relationship between TSIX and XIST expression. The X chromosome that expresses XIST does not transcribe TSIX as XIST expression leads to inactivation of that same X chromosome. On the other X chromosome, TSIX is expressed and XIST is not. This suggests that TSIX is required to block XIST expression on the active X chromosome, keeping that chromosome from being inactivated.





Sex-Linked Traits




Figure 8.31

Inheritance of Sex Chromosomes. Mothers pass only X chromosomes to their children. Fathers always pass their X chromosome to their daughters and their Y chromosome to their sons. Can you explain why fathers always determine the sex of the offspring?



Traits controlled by genes located on the sex chromosomes (X and Y) are called sex-linked traits ( Figure below ). Remember, females have two X chromosomes and males have a X and a Y chromosome. Therefore, any recessive allele on the X chromosome of a male will not be masked by a dominant allele. X-linked traits include the hemophilia and color blindness. Hemophilia is the name of a family of hereditary genetic illnesses that impair the body's ability to control coagulation. Color Blindness, or color vision deficiency, in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can distinguish.



Figure 8.32

X-linked recessive inheritance. As boys have only one X-chromosome, if they inherit the mutant allele from their mother, they will possess the phenotype that results from that allele. As shown in this example for color blindness, mothers pass the recessive allele for the trait to their sons, who pass it to their daughters.





Hemophilia


Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.

England's Queen Victoria was a carrier for this disease. The allele was passed to two of her daughters and one son. Since royal families in Europe commonly intermarried, the allele spread, and may have contributed to the downfall of the Russian monarchy. See Mendelian laws apply to human beings at http://www.dnaftb.org/13/animation.html for more on hemophilia and the royal family.

Hemophilia B is another type of hemophilia, caused by a mutation in the F9 gene, resulting in an abnormal Factor IX protein. This protein is normally also involved in the coagulation cascade. Hemophilia B is also caused by an inherited X-linked recessive trait, with the defective gene located on the X chromosome. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001564/ for more information.

Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder. Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which helps blood platelets clump together and stick to the blood vessel wall. This is necessary for normal blood clotting. The von Willebrand factor (VWF) gene located on chromosome 12.



Figure 8.33

Hemophilia is a sex-linked trait. Carrier mothers can pass along the affected allele to 50% of their sons. Females with hemophilia would have to receive an affected allele from each parent, making females with hemophilia rare.





Color Blindness


Genetic red-green color blindness affects men much more often than women, because the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome. Females are red-green color blind only if both of their X chromosomes carry the defective gene, whereas males are color blind if their single X chromosome carries the defective gene. As males have only the one X-chromosome, the gene for red-green color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters, who are usually heterozygous carriers and therefore unaffected. Subsequently, this carrier woman has a fifty percent chance of passing on a X chromosome with a defective gene to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting a X chromosome with the mutant gene from each parent.

See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001997/ for additional information.





Muscular Dystrophy


Muscular dystrophy is a term encompassing a variety of muscle wasting diseases. The most common type, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) , affects cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as some mental functions. DMD is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin, a protein prevalent in skeletal and cardiac muscles. DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder occurring in 1 in 3,500 male newborns. Because DMD is X-linked, no females are affected. Most affected individuals die before their 20th birthday. Daughters of female carriers of the mutant allele have a 50% chance of also being carriers.

The dystrophin gene, abbreviated DMD, is the largest known human gene. It is over 2 million base pairs long. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, dystrophin is part of a group of proteins (a protein complex) that work together to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax. The dystrophin complex acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's cytoskeleton with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The dystrophin complex may also play a role in cell signaling by interacting with proteins that send and receive chemical signals. Many different mutations that result in DMD have been identified in the DMD gene. These mutations typically prevent any functional dystrophin from being produced. Skeletal and cardiac muscle cells without enough functional dystrophin become damaged as the muscles contract and relax. The damaged muscle cells weaken and die over time, causing the muscle weakness and heart problems characteristic of muscular dystrophy. Other forms of muscular dystrophy exist and include Becker muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy.

See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001724/ for more information on this disease.

Is being short-statured inherited?

It can be. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism in humans, and it is caused by a dominant mutation. The mutation can be passed from one generation to the next. Over 95% of unrelated individuals with Achondroplasia have the same mutation, making it one of the most common mutations in the human genome. Why?





Mutations and Genetic Disorders


Mutations , changes in the DNA or RNA sequence, can have significant phenotypic effects or they can have no effects. What are possible outcomes of some of those mutations. Some can produce genetic disorder . A genetic disorder is a condition caused by abnormalities, such as mutations, in your genes or chromosomes. Genetic disorders are usually present from conception. These disorders include chromosomal abnormalities, in which the individual has too few or too many chromosomes or chromosomes with large alterations, or diseases due to a mutation in a specific gene. These defective genes are usually inherited from the parents, hence the term hereditary disease or genetic disorder. Genetic disorders can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner ( Figure below and Figure below ). Recessive disorders require the inheritance of a defective gene from each parent. The parents are usually unaffected and are healthy carriers of the defective gene.



Figure 8.34

Autosomal Dominant Inheritance. Only one “affected” allele is necessary to result in the “affected” phenotype. For a genetic disease inherited in this manner, only one mutant allele is necessary to result in the phenotype. Achondroplasia (discussed later) is an example of a dominant disorder. Both homozygous and heterozygous individuals will show the phenotype. Homozygous achondroplasia is usually a lethal condition.





Figure 8.35

Autosomal Recessive inheritance. For a genetic disease inherited in this manner, two mutant alleles are necessary to result in the phenotype. Tay-Sachs Disease (discussed later) is an example of a recessive disorder. Notice that both parents are unaffected carriers of the mutant allele. These unaffected carriers allow the allele to be maintained in the gene pool - the complete set of a population's genes. Even if the allele is lethal in the homozygous recessive condition, the allele will be maintained through heterozygous individuals.



How can you, or a geneticist, determine the inheritance pattern of a phenotype? A pedigree , which is essentially a representation of genetic inheritance, is helpful. A pedigree is a chart, much like a family tree, which shows all of the known individuals within a family with a particular phenotype ( Table below ). Pedigrees have been discussed in the Mendelian Inheritance in Humans concept. Examples of autosomally inherited disorders include cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, phenylketonuria, and achondroplasia.

Inheritance Pattern Description Example

Autosomal Dominant Only one mutated allele is needed for a person to be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder . Each affected person usually has one affected parent. There is a 50% chance that a child will inherit the mutated gene. Huntingtons disease, Achondroplasia, Neurofibromatosis 1, Marfan Syndrome, Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer

Autosomal Recessive Both copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder . An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers). Cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, Spinal muscular atrophy

X-linked Dominant X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern.

X-linked Recessive X-linked recessive disorders are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene. A woman who carries an X-linked recessive disorder has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene. Hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Color blindness

Y-Linked Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome. Only males can get them, and all of the sons of an affected father are affected. Y-linked disorders only cause infertility, and may be circumvented with the help of some fertility treatments. Male Infertility

Genetic Disorder Direct Effect of Mutation Signs and Symptoms of the Disorder Mode of Inheritance

Marfan syndrome defective protein in connective tissue heart and bone defects and unusually long, slender limbs and fingers autosomal dominant

Sickle cell anemia abnormal hemoglobin protein in red blood cells sickle-shaped red blood cells that clog tiny blood vessels, causing pain and damaging organs and joints autosomal recessive

Vitamin D-resistant rickets lack of a substance needed for bones to absorb minerals soft bones that easily become deformed, leading to bowed legs and other skeletal deformities X-linked dominant

Hemophilia A reduced activity of a protein needed for blood clotting internal and external bleeding that occurs easily and is difficult to control X-linked recessive





Cystic Fibrosis


Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inheritable disorder caused by a mutation in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The product of this gene is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. Although most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when individuals have a mutation in both copies of the gene, such that neither gene product works normally. CF is one of the most common life shortening diseases. Diagnosis is usually made in childhood. In the United States, approximately 1 in 3,900 children is born with CF. One in 22 people of European descent are carriers of a mutated CFTR gene. CF mainly affects the lungs and digestive system, causing difficulty breathing due to thick mucus production, progressive disability, and for some individuals, premature death.

Individuals can be diagnosed prior to birth by genetic testing. Because development of CF in the fetus requires each parent to pass on a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often initially performed on just one parent. If that parent is found to be a carrier of a CFTR gene mutation, the other parent is then tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result from more than a thousand different mutations; currently it is not possible to test for each one. As new DNA testing methodologies are developed, testing for more mutations will become more common and less expensive. Testing analyzes DNA for the most common mutations, such as a deletion of amino acid 508 (phenylalenine, also known as ΔF508). If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. However, it must be noted that because there may be other not yet identified mutations that result in CF, and as not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.





Tay-Scahs Disease


Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that is fatal in its most common variant, known as Infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs is an autosomal recessive disorder, requiring the inheritance of a defective gene from each parent. The disease results from the accumulation of harmful quantities of fat in the nerve cells of the brain. Tay-Sachs results from mutations in the HEXA gene located on chromosome 15, which encodes the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, which normally breaks down the fat. More than 90 mutations, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, splice site mutations, and other more complex patterns have been characterized in this gene, and new mutations are still being reported. Each of these mutations alters the protein product, inhibiting the function of the enzyme.

Tay-Sachs disease is a rare disease. Unaffected carriers of a Tay-Sachs allele may not know they have the allele. Other autosomal disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia are far more common. The importance of Tay-Sachs lies in the fact that an inexpensive enzyme assay test was developed. The automation of this analysis has provided one of the first "mass screening" tools in medical genetics. Two unaffected carriers can have a child homozygous for a Tay-Sachs allele, resulting, currently, in a lethal phenotype. Tay-Sachs alleles are maintained in a population through these unknowing heterozygous carriers.

Anyone can be a carrier of the Tay-Sachs mutation, but the disease is most common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population. About 1 in every 27 members of the Ashkenazi Jewish population carries the Tay-Sachs gene. The analysis and screening for Tay-Sachs has became a research and public health model for understanding and preventing all autosomal genetic disorders. Another genetic disease that is easily analyzed is phenylketonuria.

Phenylketonuria


Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. PKU is due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). When PAH is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylketones, which can be detected in the urine. Left untreated, this condition can cause problems with brain development, leading to progressive mental retardation and seizures. However, PKU can be treated with a specific diet, one low in phenylalanine. A diet low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine can bring about a nearly total cure.

The incidence of PKU is about 1 in 15,000 live births. In the United States PKU is screened at birth as part of a national biochemical screening program, for every baby born in a hospital. Babies born at home may not be screened. If PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development, but only by eating a special diet low in phenylalanine for the rest of his or her life. In essence, this is a protein-free diet. This requires severely restricting or eliminating foods high in protein content (containing phenylalanine), such as breast milk, meat, chicken, fish, nuts, cheese and other dairy products. Starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, pasta, and corn must also be monitored. Many diet foods and diet soft drinks that contain the sweetener aspartame must also be avoided, as aspartame consists of two amino acids: phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Supplementary infant formulas are used in these patients to provide the amino acids and other necessary nutrients that would otherwise be lacking in their diet. Since phenylalanine is required for the synthesis of many proteins, it is necessary to have some of this amino acid, but levels must be strictly controlled. In addition, the amino acid tyrosine, which is normally derived from phenylalanine, must also be supplemented.





Achondroplasia


Whereas cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, and phenylketonuria are all autosomal recessive disorders, achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism in humans. Achondroplasia is a result of an autosomal dominant mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene 3 (FGFR3), which causes an abnormality of cartilage formation. FGFR3 normally has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active (constantly “turned on”) and this leads to severely shortened bones. Individuals with achondroplasia are heterozygous for the mutation (one mutant copy, one normal copy). Homozygous for the achondroplasia mutation is lethal prior to birth or shortly after birth.

For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome.

There are three other syndromes with a genetic basis similar to achondroplasia: hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and SADDAN Dysplasia (severe achondroplasia, developmental delay, acanthuses nigricans, a skin condition). Each of these disorders is also caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Each of the conditions results in a distinct difference in the degree of severity of the phenotype, with hypochondroplasia having the mildest phenotype and thanatophoric dysplasia being a lethal condition.

Other genes in which mutations cause a phenotypic spectrum of disease include the type I and type II collagen genes, among others. Mutations in the type I collagen genes result in bone disorders, specifically the spectrum of osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease. Mutations in the type II collagen disease result in disorders of cartilage, including Achondrogenesis type II, hypochondrogenesis, Kniest Dysplasia, the SEDs (spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia) and Stickler Syndrome.





KQED: Treating Genetic Disorders


The symptoms of genetic disorders can sometimes be treated, but cures for genetic disorders are still in the early stages of development. One potential cure that has already been used with some success is gene therapy . This involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant genes.

Complex Traits - Advanced


Discuss complex inheritance patterns.

Define codominant alleles and give examples.

Define incomplete dominance.





What does it mean to be dominant?

Well, if you're in this gorilla's troop, it better be obvious. Could there be more than one dominant gorilla in a troop? No. So what happens if there are two dominant alleles of the same gene. Do they fight until one leaves? Or do they figure out how to get along?





Complex Traits


Traits inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern are either dominate or recessive. The trait is produced by only one gene. But this is not the case for many traits; rarely is inheritance as simple as one gene with two alleles, and either dominant or recessive inheritance. More complex patterns of inheritance are common. These were introduced in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept.

Mendel’s pea plants showed complete dominance of one allele over the other. The offspring always completely looked like one of the parents – there was never any phenotype “in between” the two parents. The heterozygous individuals were indistinguishable from the homozygous dominant individuals. Is it possible for both alleles to be dominant, or neither to be completely dominant? The answer to both of these questions is yes.





Codominance


Codominance is when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous individual; that is, they both affect the phenotype in separate and distinguishable ways ( Figure below ). The A, B alleles of the ABO blood group system are a classic example, and these have been discussed in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept. The A and B alleles are codominant with each other. When a person has both an A and a B allele, the person has type AB blood. When two persons with AB blood type have children, the children can be type A, type B, or type AB. There is a 1A:2AB:1B phenotype ratio instead of the 3:1 phenotype ratio found when one allele is dominant and the other is recessive.

I A I A I A Type A I A I B Type AB I A i Type A

I B I A I B Type AB I B I B Type B I B i Type B

i iI A Type A iI B Type B ii Type O



Figure 8.36

Codominant Inheritance. The A and B alleles are codominant. An AB heterozygous individual has type AB blood.





Hemoglobin Beta Gene


Hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen-transport protein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates. The hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein subunits, each tightly associated with a non-protein heme group. The heme group binds to the iron ion. The most common hemoglobin is hemoglobin A, a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits, denoted as α2β2.

Another example of codominance in humans is with the locus for the Beta-globin component of hemoglobin. The two alleles Hb A and Hb S produce three polypeptides complexes based on the combinations of alleles: Hb A /Hb A , Hb A /Hb S , and Hb S /Hb S . In heterozygous individuals, both the alleles are expressed. Normal hemoglobin is produced with the Hb A allele, while Hb S turns normal, round red blood cells into abnormally curved (sickle) shapes. Hb S /Hb S results in sickle-cell disease , whereas the heterozygous Hb A /Hb S results in the phenotypically distinct sickle-cell trait .

Sickle cell disease confers some resistance to malaria parasitization of red blood cells, so that individuals with sickle-cell trait (heterozygotes), who do not have sickle-cell disease, have a selective advantage in some environments.



Figure 8.37

In sickle cell disease or sickle cell anemia, Hb S /Hb S homozygotes have sickle shaped red blood cells which block blood flow. Due to codominance, Hb A /Hb S heterozygotes have a mixture of normal and sickle shaped cells.





Incomplete Dominance


Incomplete dominance is seen in heterozygous individuals with an intermediate phenotype. For example, if Mendel had ever observed a medium stem length plant when a tall and short plant were crossed, that would have suggested incomplete dominance. In incomplete dominant situations, the phenotype expression is dependent on the dosage of the genes. Two copies of the gene result in full expression, while only one copy produces partial expression and an intermediate phenotype.

The most well-studied example of incomplete dominance in humans occurs in the genes for curly hair. Inheriting a gene for curly hair from one parent and a gene for straight hair from the other parent will give a hair with a phenotype intermediate between curly and straight hair, which is wavy hair. Human height is also due to incomplete dominance, although there is more than one gene involved in height.



Figure 8.38

In this replica of Michaelangelo's David, wavy hair is apparent.





Vocabulary


codominance : Occurs when both traits appear in a heterozygous individual.



hemoglobin : The iron-containing oxygen-transport protein found in red blood cells; allows oxygen to be transported in the blood.



incomplete dominance : Occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele is not present.



sickle-cell disease : Disease in which red blood cells form an abnormal sickle or crescent shape; also known as sickle-cell anemia.



sickle-cell trait : A condition in which a peron produces normal and sickle-shaped red blood cells; due to heterozygosity for the normal and abnormal hemoglobin beta alleles.





Summary


Codominance is when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygous individual.

Incomplete dominance is seen in heterozygous individuals with an intermediate phenotype.

Multiple-Allele Traits - Advanced


Give examples of multiple allele traits.





What does it mean to block?

This goalie's main job is to block the puck from getting into the net. Is it possible for one gene to block another? With genes, almost anything seems possible. Under the right conditions, one gene may inhibit another gene. That's how some people end up with red hair. And it's called epistasis.





Multiple-Allele Traits


Traits controlled by more than two alleles have multiple alleles . Although any one person usually has only two alleles for a gene, more than two alleles can exist in the population's gene pool . Theoretically, any base change will result in a new allele. In fact, within the human population, it may be safe to say that most human genes have more than two alleles. Whereas, we think of base changes, or mutations, as resulting in a new phenotype or disease, many base changes result in alleles that do not cause significant change in phenotypes. This is common in collagen genes, for example. Type I and type II collagen are fibrillar proteins composed of a triple helix. As these are structural proteins found in bone and cartilage, a triple helix adds strength to the matrix with these proteins. To form a triple helix structure, a glycine residue must be placed at every third amino acid within the fibrillar segment of the protein. The fibrillar portion of the protein is composed of Gly-X-Y motif, where X and Y represent two additional amino acids. As glycine is encoded by four codons: GGG, GGC, GGA, GGU, any change of sequence in the third position of the codon will not have an effect on the protein structure. Furthermore some changes in the X and Y positions of the Gly-X-Y motif may not cause significant phenotypic changes. However, other changes may have significant, even lethal consequences.



Figure 8.39

The collagen triple helix molecule. The three strands, each its own polypeptide, wind together to form the triple helix structure. This requires a glycine residue every third amino acid.



See http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v3/n6/box/nrc1094_BX1.html for additional information on collagen.

The best characterized example of multiple alleles in humans is the ABO blood groups, discussed in the Non-Mendelian Inheritance concept. Other human traits determined by multiple alleles would be hair color, hair texture, eye color, built, physical structures, etc. Most, if not all of these multiple-allele traits are in traits with very diverse phenotypic possibilities.

It is easiest to consider situations where each gene affects only one phenotypic characteristic. However, other situations where genes have other effects are common. As mentioned above, multiple alleles resulting in multiple phenotypes are not uncommon.





Pleiotropy


Many genes have multiple phenotypic effects, a property called pleiotropy . Thus, a new mutation in the gene will affect all the phenotypes/traits associated with the gene simultaneously. For example, the symptoms associated with sickle-cell disease are due to pleiotropic effects. Individuals with sickle-cell disease are homozygous for the mutant allele, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells. Because the sickle-shaped red blood cells deliver less oxygen to the tissues, sickle-cell disease has many pleiotropic effects. Symptoms include pain in the bones of the back, the long bones, and the chest. As the disease progresses, additional symptoms develop. These include fatigue, paleness, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice).

People with sickle cell trait are heterozygous for the mutation. They do not have the symptoms of sickle cell anemia. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001554/ for additional information on sickle cell disease.

Another example is the collagen genes mentioned above. Many bones develop from a cartilage template. This cartilage template is made out of many proteins, with type II collagen, the predominant protein in the cartilage. The gene for this collagen, COL2A1, when mutated, not only affects the skeletal system, but due to its pleiotropic nature, it may also affect a person’s eyes and hearing.





Epistasis


Epistasis is when a gene at one location (locus) alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at another locus. Epistasis takes place when the action of one gene is modified by one or several other genes. These genes are sometimes called modifier genes . The gene whose phenotype is expressed is said to be epistatic , while the phenotype that is altered is said to be hypostatic . Sometimes hypostatic phenotypes are completely suppressed. Epistatic genes are not dominant over the genes they alter or suppress. Dominance refers to an interaction between alleles of the same gene, not different genes.

Examples of epistasis can be seen at both the genomic level and the phenotypic level. At the genomic level, it is highly possible that under certain conditions one gene could code for a protein that prevents transcription of the other gene. At the phenotypic level, examples include the gene causing albinism hiding the gene controlling the color of a person's hair. In another example, a gene coding for a widow's peak would be hidden by a gene causing baldness.

Epistasis is also seen in people with red hair. These individuals are homozygous for the red hair alleles, masking the expression at the brown/blonde hair loci, resulting in red hair. At least two genes are involved in hair color. One hair color phenotype (brown vs. blond) has a dominant brown allele and a recessive blond allele. A person with a brown allele will have brown hair; a person with no brown alleles will be blond. This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child. The other gene pair has a non-red vs. red set of alleles, where the non-red allele is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive. A person with two copies of the red-haired allele will have red hair, but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair, respectively.



Figure 8.40

Red hair is due to an epistatic effect on the brown/blonde hair color locus.

Human height. Just two phenotypes?

Of course not. Human height exhibits a large range of phenotypes. Normal phenotypes range from under 5 feet tall to over 7 feet tall. How does such a wide range occur? Well, not just from one gene.





Polygenic Traits


Polygenic traits are due to the actions of more than one gene and often, their interaction with the environment. These usually result in a measurable range in phenotype, such as height, eye color or skin color. These are known as multifactoral or quantitative characteristics. Polygenic inheritance results in an additive effect of the genes on a single phenotype.

Human skin color is primarily due to the presence of the pigment melanin in the skin. Melanin is not a protein, but it is the product of a biosynthetic pathway. Skin color is a polygenic trait and obviously demonstrates quantitative characteristics. A number of genes factor into determining a person's natural skin color, so modifying only one of those genes changes the color only slightly. It is currently thought that at least three separately inherited genes contribute to skin pigmentation. Let’s call these three genes A, B, and C. A, B, and C are incompletely dominant to a, b, and c, with A, B, and C each contributing a “unit of darkness” to the phenotype. Therefore an AABBCC individual is very dark, darker than an AaBbCc individual, and much darker than a aabbcc individual. A person may have as many as 6 “dark units” to as few as no “dark units,” and any combination in between. This will result in a phenotypic spectrum of color gradation. When graphed, a phenotypic spectrum usually results in a bell-shaped curve, with extreme phenotypes on both ends and more common phenotypes in the center of the curve.

Another example of a human polygenic trait is adult height. If human height followed simple Mendelian genetics, than people would either be tall or short, with both phenotypes probably falling into a very narrow range. But like skin color, humans height fall into essentially a phenotypic spectrum. Within the human population, every conceivable height between less than 5 feet and over 7 feet probably exists. This range can not be controlled by just one gene with two alleles. In fact, several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to human height, resulting in many possible adult heights. For example, one adult’s height might be 1.655 m (5.430 feet), and another adult’s height might be 1.656 m (5.433 feet) tall. Adult height ranges from less than 5 feet to more than 6 feet, but the majority of people fall near the middle of the range, as shown in Figure below .



Figure 8.41

Human Adult Height. Like many other polygenic traits, adult height has a bell-shaped distribution.



Many disorders with genetic components are polygenic, including autism, certain cancers, diabetes and numerous others. Most phenotypic characteristics are the result of the interaction of multiple genes. The environment plays a significant role in many of these phenotypes. But what happens when multiple genes are either missing or duplicated?





Changes in Chromosome Number


So far we have focused on traits due to one gene or several genes. But what about many genes? 100s or 1000s of genes? What would happen if an entire chromosome were missing or duplicated? What if a human had only 45 chromosomes? Or 47? This real possibility is usually due to mistakes during meiosis; the chromosomes do not fully separate from each other during sperm or egg formation. Specifically, nondisjunction is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during anaphase II. If a zygote forms from a gamete lacking a chromosome, a viable embryo cannot be produced. Most human abnormal chromosome numbers result in the death of the developing embryo, often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant. Occasionally, a zygote with an extra chromosome can become a viable embryo and develop.

Trisomy is a state where humans have an extra autosome. That is, they have three of a particular chromosome instead of two. For example, trisomy 18 results from an extra chromosome 18, resulting in 47 total chromosomes. To identify the chromosome number (including an abnormal number), a sample of cells is removed from an individual or developing fetus. Metaphase chromosomes are photographed and a karyotype is produced. A karyotype will display any abnormalities in chromosome number or large chromosomal rearrangements. Trisomy 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 21 have been identified in humans. Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy in humans, occurring in more than 1% of pregnancies. This condition, however, usually results in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester. The most common trisomy in viable births is Trisomy 21 .





Trisomy 21: Down Syndrome


One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older.

See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001992/ for additional information.



Figure 8.42

Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) Karyotype. A karyotype is a picture of a cell's chromosomes. Note the extra chromosome 21. Child with Down syndrome, exhibiting characteristic facial appearance.





Abnormal Numbers of Sex Chromosomes


What about when a person has more than two Y chromosomes, or more than two X chromosomes? Or a female with only one X chromosome? Sex-chromosome abnormalities may be caused by nondisjunction of one or more sex chromosomes. Many conditions are known in which there are an abnormal number of sex chromosomes. An X chromosome may be missing (XO), or there may be an extra one (XXX or XXY). There may also be an extra Y chromosome (XYY). Any combination of X and Y chromosomes, as long as there is a Y chromosome, will produce a male (up to XXXXY). These individuals can lead relatively normal lives, but they cannot have children. They may also have some degree of mental retardation. These syndromes include Klinefelter’s syndrome, Turner syndrome and trisomy X.

Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.

Genetic Disorder Genotype Phenotypic Effects

Down syndrome extra copy (complete or partial) of chromosome 21 (see Figure above ) developmental delays, distinctive facial appearance, and other abnormalities (see Figure above )

Turner’s syndrome one X chromosome but no other sex chromosome (XO) female with short height and infertility (inability to reproduce)

Triple X syndrome three X chromosomes (XXX) female with mild developmental delays and menstrual irregularities

Klinefelter’s syndrome one Y chromosome and two or more X chromosomes (XXY, XXXY) male with problems in sexual development and reduced levels of the male hormone testosterone

Diagnosis and Treatment of Genetic Disorders - Advanced


Discuss the importance of gene therapy.

Describe the most common method of gene therapy.





Can you cure genetic disorders?

Currently it is difficult. To truly "cure" a genetic disorder, you would have to replace the mutant DNA with non mutant DNA. If only it were as easy as just injecting the nonmutant DNA through a syringe.





Diagnosis and Treatment of Genetic Disorders


If someone has a rare genetic disease in her family, can she still have a baby? Is she predisposed to pass that phenotype along to her child? These are questions for a professional trained in human genetics. A geneticist and genetic counselor are usually involved in the diagnosis and treatment of human genetic disorders. Families with a genetic disease are referred to a genetic counselor, especially when they wish to determine a baby’s likelihood of inheriting the genetic disease.

Individuals or their families at risk of inheriting a genetic disorder have many questions.

What exactly is a genetic disorder?

How does a person get it?

Can it be passed onto the next generation?

Can it be treated?

What are the symptoms?

Do the symptoms get worse with age?



These and many more questions are where a genetic specialist, such as a genetic counselor can help. Genetic counseling is the process by which individuals or their families who are at risk of an inherited disorder, are counseled on many different aspects of the disorder. Genetic counseling may be necessary at any time throughout life, from before pregnancy to adulthood. Before pregnancy, genetic counseling would be appropriate for at risk individuals who are planning a family, such as when one or both individuals are either carriers or have a certain genetic trait. During pregnancy, genetic counseling is necessary for couples if the woman will be over 35 years of age at the time of delivery, if prenatal testing is recommended for any reason, or if an abnormality is noted on an ultrasound or other test. After birth, genetic counseling is appropriate if a birth defect is detected. During childhood, genetic counseling is appropriate if the child manifests any signs of developmental delay or a genetic syndrome, and in adulthood, genetic counseling is appropriate if signs of an adult onset genetic disorder is detected. During genetic counseling, individuals are advised of the consequences and nature of the disorder, the probability of developing or transmitting the disorder, and the options open to them in management and family planning in order to make appropriate decisions. In terms of the actual diagnosis of the disease, molecular analysis may be necessary. Molecular analysis or testing is discussed in the Biotechnology concepts.





Prenatal Diagnosis


"Is it possible to test the developing baby for potential genetic problems? Do you need to remove some of the baby's DNA? How do you do that?"

These questions are appropriate for a geneticist. Sometimes, to make sure the baby is developing properly, prenatal diagnosis is necessary. Prenatal diagnosis refers to the diagnosis of a disease or condition before the baby is born. The reason for prenatal diagnosis is to detect birth defects such as neural tube defects, chromosome abnormalities, genetic diseases and other conditions. It can also be used to determine the sex of the unborn baby, though this can usually be determined by ultrasonography (ultrasound).

Diagnostic prenatal testing can be by invasive methods or non-invasive methods. Non-invasive methods are much less risky to the patient. Non-invasive methods can only evaluate the risk of a condition and cannot actually determine if the fetus has a condition. Non-invasive techniques include examinations of the mother's womb through ultrasonography and analysis of maternal serum. If an abnormality is indicated by a non-invasive procedure, a more invasive technique may be employed to gather more information. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are invasive procedures. These involve probes or needles that are inserted into the placenta. Amniocentesis can be done from about 14 weeks up to about 20 weeks of the pregnancy and CVS can be done earlier, between 9.5 and 12.5 weeks, but is slightly more risky to the unborn child.

During Amniocentesis a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal cells, is extracted from the amnion or amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. Amniocentesis is not performed for every pregnancy, but is generally done when an increased risk of genetic defects in the fetus is indicated, by mother's age (over 35 years is common), family history of genetic defects, or other factors.

Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) involves removing a sample of the chorionic villus (placental tissue) and testing it. It is generally carried out only on pregnant women over the age of 35 and those whose offspring have a higher risk of Down syndrome and other chromosomal conditions. The advantage of CVS is that it can be carried out 10-12 weeks after the last period, earlier than amniocentesis.

DNA from the developing baby may be isolated from either an amniocentesis or CVS. A karyotype may be created from fetal chromosomes following either procedure, or a specific mutation may be analyzed.

So, how do you treat genetic disorders? If medically possible, each manifestation of a genetic disease can be treated separately. But is there a way to use genetics to treat the root cause of the disease – that is, to fix the mistake in the DNA?

Gene therapy is the insertion of a new gene into an individual’s cells and tissues to treat a disease, replacing a mutant disease-causing allele with a normal, non-mutant allele. Although the technology is still in its early stages of development, it has been used with some success.

There are a number of mechanisms used to replace or repair a defective gene in gene therapy.

A normal gene may be inserted into a nonspecific location within the genome to replace a nonfunctional gene. This approach is most common.

An abnormal gene could be replaced by a normal gene through homologous recombination.

The abnormal gene could be repaired through selective reverse mutation, which returns the gene to its normal, non-mutant state.

The regulation (the degree to which a gene is turned on or off) of a particular gene could be altered.



As stated above, the most common gene therapy approach is to replace a disease-causing allele with a normal allele. To deliver the new allele to the appropriate cells, a carrier, called a vector , must be used. Currently, the most common type of vectors are viruses that have been genetically altered to carry normal human DNA, and not to result in any phenotypes associated with the virus. As viruses have evolved a robust method of delivering their viral genes to human cells, scientists have tried to develop (and are continuing to develop) methods to take advantage of this process, and have these vectors insert human DNA into target cells. Scientists have manipulated the viral genome to remove disease-causing genes and insert therapeutic human genes ( Figure below ). For obvious reasons, this is currently a field of intense biomedical research.



Figure 8.43

Gene Therapy using a viral vector. The new gene is inserted into the viral genome, the virus binds to the cell membrane and enters the cell by endocytosis. The viral genome, containing the new gene is injected into the cell nucleus, where the viral DNA is transcribed, starting the process of protein synthesis.



A patient's target cells, such as liver or lung cells are infected with the genetically altered virus. The vector then unloads its genetic material containing the therapeutic human gene into the target cell. The generation of a functional protein product from the therapeutic gene should restore the target cell to a normally functioning phenotype. To date, this process has had limited success, but further research should improve results.





Severe Combined Immunodeficiency


Severe Combined Immunodeficiency , or SCID, is a heritable immunodeficiency - a genetic disorder that cripples the immune system. It is also known as the "bubble boy" disease, named after David Vetter, SCID’s most famous patient who lived for over 12 years in a sterilized environment, just like living inside a “bubble.” SCID affects about 1 in 100,000 live births. These babies, if untreated, usually die within one year due to severe, recurrent infections. Treatment options have improved considerably and include bone marrow transplants and gene therapy. Children no longer have to live inside a bubble as did David Vetter, who was placed inside his sterile bubble about 10 seconds after birth. He died 15 days after he left his sterile environment, due to an undetected virus in the bone marrow transplant. David was one of the first bone marrow recipients.

More recently gene therapy has proved successful in treating SCID. Insertion of the correct gene into cells of the immune system should correct the problem. Trials started in 1990, and in 1999, the first SCID patients were detected with functional immune systems. Due to some complications these trials had to be stopped, but these issues seem to have been resolved. Since 1999, gene therapy has restored the immune systems of at least seventeen children with the disorder. This raises great hope for other genetic disorders. In your lifetime, it is definitely possible that many genetic disorders may be “cured” by gene therapy.

With this technique and its great possibilities, no one can predict what will happen in the future, but it could have profound effects on the future of medicine.

Molecular Biology - Advanced


Introduction




What molecule determines many of your traits?

Biology of the Molecule. This concept focuses on DNA and proteins, and specifically how the "instructions" in DNA are used to make proteins. This model depicts a protein binding to DNA. Notice the "spiral staircase" shape of the DNA molecule, with the globular wrapped protein around it.





DNA - Advanced


Describe the role of DNA.





What large organic molecule has a spiral shape, and may be the most important molecule to life?

Here’s a hint: molecules like this one determine who you are. They contain genetic information that controls your characteristics. They determine your eye color, facial features, and other physical attributes. What molecule is it?

You probably answered “DNA.” Today, it is commonly known that DNA is the genetic material. For a long time, scientists knew such molecules existed. They were aware that genetic information was contained within organic molecules. However, they didn’t know which type of molecules play this role. In fact, for many decades, scientists thought that proteins were the molecules that carry genetic information. In these concepts, you will learn how scientists discovered that DNA carries the code of life.





DNA and RNA


What tells the first cell of an organism what to do? How does that first cell know to divide and become two cells, then four cells, and so on? Does this cell have instructions? What are those instructions and what do they really do? What happens when those instructions don’t work properly? Are the “instructions” the genetic material? Though today it seems completely obvious that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA , is the genetic material, this was not always known.

Practically everything a cell does, be it a liver cell, a skin cell, or a bone cell, it does because of proteins. It is your proteins that make a bone cell act like a bone cell, a liver cell act like a liver cell, or a skin cell act like a skin cell. It is the proteins that perform the functions of the cell, and of course, many of those functions are specific for the bone cell, liver cell, skin cell, or any other type of cell. In other words, it is the proteins that give an organism its traits. We know that it is your proteins that that make you tall or short, have light or dark skin, or have brown or blue eyes. But what tells those proteins how to act? It is the structure of the protein that determines its function. And it is the order and type of amino acids that determine the structure of the protein. And that order and type of amino acids that make up the protein are determined by your DNA sequence.

The relatively large chromosomes that never leave the nucleus are made of DNA. And, as proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, how does the information encoded in the DNA get to the site of protein synthesis? That’s where RNA comes into this three-player act.

DNA → RNA → Protein

That’s known as the central dogma of molecular biology . It states that “DNA makes RNA makes protein.” Really it means that the genetic information within DNA is used to make smaller molecules of RNA, which leave the nucleus and then the genetic information in RNA is used to assemble amino acids into proteins. But this process does start with DNA. To understand the role of DNA in this process, it first had to be shown that DNA is the genetic material.



Figure 9.1

DNA winds into the familiar double helix configuration. However, it is the order of the four bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine) that provide the genetic information/instructions. These will be discussed in additional concepts.

The Hereditary Material - Advanced


Discuss how the work of Griffith, Avery, Hershey, and Chase demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material.

Define transformation and explain that transformation is the change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of the external DNA by a cell.





DNA or Protein?

Which is the hereditary material? 100 years ago, it was not known. Some thought it was protein, others thought it was DNA. This image actually represents both DNA and protein, in the form of the enzyme DNA polymerase I, an enzyme involved in DNA replication. Here it is shown interacting with DNA.





The Hereditary Material


For almost 100 years, scientists have known plenty about proteins. They have known that proteins of all different shapes, sizes, and functions exist. For this reason, many scientists believed that proteins were the heredity material. It wasn’t until 1928, when Frederick Griffith identified the process of transformation , that individuals started to question this concept. Griffith demonstrated that transformation occurs, but what was the material that caused the transforming process?





Frederick Griffith


Griffith was studying Streptococcus pneumoniae , a bacterium that infects mammals. He used two strains of this bacteria, a virulent S (smooth) strain and a harmless R (rough) strain to demonstrate the transfer of genetic material. The S strain is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, which protects it from the host's immune system, resulting in the death of the host, while the R strain, which does not have the protective capsule, is defeated by the host's immune system. Hence, when mammalian cells are infected with the R strain bacteria, the host does not die ( Figure below ).

Griffith infected mice with heat-killed S strain bacteria. As expected, the heat-killed bacteria, as they were dead, had no effect on the mice. But then he tried a novel experiment. He mixed the remains of heat-killed S strain bacteria with live R strain bacteria and injected the mixture into mice. Remember, separately both of these bacteria are harmless to the mice. And yet the mice died ( Figure below ). Why? These mice had both live R and live S strain bacteria in their blood. How? Griffith concluded that the R strain had changed, or transformed, into the lethal S strain. Something, such as the "instructions” from the remains of the S strain, had to move into the R strain in order to turn the harmless R strain into the lethal S strain. This material that was transferred between strains had to be the heredity material. But the transforming material had yet to be identified. Transformation is now known as the change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA (heredity material) by a cell.



Figure 9.2

Griffith’s Experimental Results. Griffith showed that a substance could be transferred to harmless bacteria and make them deadly. The rough (R) strain has no effect on the mouse, whereas the smooth (S) strain is harmful to the mouse. Heat-killed S strain also has no effect on the mouse, but the mixture of heat-killed S strain and the R strain is harmful to the mouse.





Oswald Avery and Colleagues


Over the next decade, scientists, led by Oswald Avery, tried to identify the material involved in transformation. Avery, together with his colleagues Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLeod, removed various organic compounds from S strain bacteria and tested the remaining compounds for the ability to cause transformation. If the remaining material did not cause transformation, than that material could not be the heredity material.

Avery and his colleagues treated the S strain bacteria with the protease enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, or ribonuclease or deoxyribonuclease , mixed the remaining extract with R strain bacteria, and asked if transformation of the R strain bacteria still occurred. They found that the proteases, which remove proteins from cells, and ribonuclease, which break apart RNA, did not affect transformation, but an enzyme preparation of deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA, destroyed the transforming power. Together, these results showed that neither proteins nor RNA carried the "instructions" (or the genes) which allowed transformation. These results also indicated that DNA was the heredity material. The year was 1944.

However, this finding was not widely accepted, partly because so little was known about DNA. It was still thought that proteins were better candidates to be the heredity material. The structure of DNA was still unknown, and many scientists were not convinced that genes from bacteria and more complex organisms could be similar. See A gene is made of DNA at http://www.dnaftb.org/17/animation.html to see Oswald Avery describe his Griffith's and his work.

Avery–MacLeod–McCarty Experiment Treatment Destroys Transformation

proteases protein yes

ribonuclease RNA yes

deoxyribonuclease DNA no





Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase


In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase put this skepticism to rest. They conclusively demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material. Hershey and Chase used the T2 bacteriophage , a virus that infects bacteria, to prove this point. A virus is essentially DNA (or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat ( Figure below ). To reproduce, a virus must infect a cell and use that host cell’s machinery to make more viruses, a replicative process known as the lytic cycle . The T2 bacteriophage can quickly turn an Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria into a T2 producing system. But to do that, the genetic material from T2, which could only be either protein or DNA, must be transferred to the bacteria. Which one was it?



Figure 9.3

Structural overview of T2 phage. A 2-dimensional representation is on the left, and a 3-dimensional representation is on the right. The phage is essentially nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat.



Hershey and Chase performed a series of classic experiments, taking advantage of the fact that T2 is essentially just DNA and protein. In the experiments, T2 phages with either radioactive 32 P-labeled DNA or radioactive 35 S-labeled protein were used to infect bacteria. Either the radioactive proteins or radioactive DNA would be transferred to the bacteria, depending on which one was the genetic material. Thus, identifying which one was transferred would identify the genetic material. In both experiments, bacteria were separated from the phage coats by blending, followed by centrifugation. Hershey and Chase then asked which phase following centrifugation was radioactive: the supernatant or the cell pellet. They also asked what was the radioactivity in the bacterial pellet: 32 P or 35 S.

Only the radioactively labeled DNA was found inside the bacteria, whereas the radioactive proteins stayed in the solution ( Figure below ). These experiments demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material and that protein does not transmit genetic information.



Figure 9.4

The Hershey and Chase experiment. T2 virus with either radioactive protein (upper section) or radioactive DNA (lower section) were used to infect bacteria. A blender was used to remove the phage from the bacteria followed by centrifugation. The radioactive DNA was found inside the bacteria (lower section), demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.



See Bacteria and viruses have DNA too at http://www.dnaftb.org/18/animation.html for a description of the work of Joshua Lederberg.

bacteriophage : A virus that infects and replicates within bacteria; also known as phage.



deoxyribonuclease : A type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of DNA; DNase.



lytic cycle : Cycle of viral reproduction in which the virus kills the host, releasing newly formed virions.

Chargaff's Base-Pairing Rules - Advanced


Discuss the findings of Chargaff.

Describe the importance of the finding that in DNA, the amount of adenine and thymine were about the same and that the amount of guanine and cytosine were about the same.





How do these four structures form DNA?

In an extremely elegant model, that's how. The model of DNA predicts how the DNA sequence can code for proteins, and how the molecule can be replicated. But one initial significant step was to understand the base-pairing rules.





Chargaff’s Rules


It was known that DNA is composed of nucleotides , each of which contains a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. In these nucleotides, there is one of the four possible bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T) ( Figure below ). Adenine and guanine are purine bases, and cytosine and thymine are pyrimidine bases.



Figure 9.5

Chemical structure of the four nitrogenous bases in DNA. Notice how the purines (A and G) are composed of two ring structures, whereas the pyrimidines (T and C) are composed of one ring structure. The DNA of all species has the same four nitrogen bases.



Erwin Chargaff (1905-2002), an Austrian-American biochemist from Columbia University, analyzed the base composition of the DNA of various species. This led him to propose two main rules that have been appropriately named Chargaff's rules .





Rule 1


Chargaff determined that in DNA, the amount of one base, a purine, always approximately equals the amount of a particular second base, a pyrimidine. Specifically, that in any double-stranded DNA the number of guanine units equals approximately the the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units equals approximately the number of thymine units.

Human DNA is 30.9% A and 29.4% T, 19.9% G and 19.8% C. The rule constitutes the basis of base pairs in the DNA double helix: A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. He also demonstrated that the number of purines (A+G) always approximates the number of pyrimidines (T+C), an obvious consequence of the base-pairing nature of the DNA double helix.





Rule 2


In 1947 Chargaff showed that the composition of DNA, in terms of the relative amounts of the A, C, G and T bases, varied from one species to another. This molecular diversity added evidence that DNA could be the genetic material.





Samples


The following Table below is a representation of Erwin Chargaff's 1952 data. This table lists the base composition of DNA from various organisms. Data from this table supports both of Chargaff's rules.



Click on the image above to view the table





Vocabulary


adenine : A purine base found in DNA paired with thymine and in RNA paired with uracil.



base pair : Two nitrogenous bases on opposite complementary DNA strands; connected by hydrogen bonds; may also occur in certain types of RNAs.



Chargaff's rules : State that DNA from any cell of all organisms should have a 1:1 ratio of pyrimidine and purine bases; specifically, the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine.



cytosine : A pyrimidine base found in DNA and RNA paired with guanine.



guanine : A purine base found in DNA and RNA paired with cytosine.



nucleotide : Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar, and a phosphate group.



purine : Nitrogenous bases consisting of two ring structures; adenine and guanine.



pyrimidine : Nitrogenous bases consisting of one ring structure; thymine and cytosine.



thymine : A pyrimidine base found in DNA paired with adenine.





Summary


Chargaff's rule 1 is that the number of guanine units approximately equals the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units approximately equals the number of thymine units.

Chargaff's rule 2 is that the composition of DNA varied from one species to another.

The base paring rules state that A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C.

The DNA Double Helix - Advanced


Explain Watson and Crick’s double helix model of DNA.





How do sugars, phosphate groups and bases form DNA?

In an extremely elegant model, that's how. The base-pairing rules tell us that A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. But how does all this information, all these nucleotides, form the molecule known as DNA? It took the work of four distinguished scientists, three distinguished gentlemen one under-appreciated legendary woman, to solve this mystery.





The Double Helix


In the early 1950s, Rosalind Franklin started working on understanding the structure of DNA fibers. Franklin, together with Maurice Wilkins, used her expertise in x-ray diffraction photographic techniques to analyze the structure of DNA. In February 1953, Francis Crick and James D. Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a model of DNA. Watson and Crick indirectly obtained Franklin's DNA X-ray diffraction data demonstrating crucial information into the DNA structure. Francis Crick and James Watson ( Figure below ) then published their double helical model of DNA in Nature on April 25th, 1953: http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf .



Figure 9.6

James Watson (left, about the time of the discovery of the double helix) and Francis Crick (right, photo taken many years later).



DNA has the shape of a double helix , just like a spiral staircase ( Figure below ). As a nucleic acid, DNA is composed of nucleotide monomers, consisting of the deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (A, C, G or T). There are two sides to the double helix, called the sugar-phosphate backbone , as they are made from alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars. The “steps” of the double helix are made from the base pairs formed between the nitrogenous bases. The DNA double helix is held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases attached to the two strands.



Figure 9.7

The DNA double helix. The two sides are the sugar-phosphate backbones, composed of alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars. The nitrogenous bases face the center of the double helix. As the base-pairing rules tell us, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C.



See The DNA molecule is shaped like a twisted ladder at http://www.dnaftb.org/19/animation.html to see Watson talk about this historic work.





Complementary Base Pairs


The double helical nature of DNA, together with the findings of Chargaff, demonstrated the base-pairing nature of the bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine ( Figure below ). Because of this complementary nature of DNA, the bases on one strand determine the bases on the other strand. These complementary base pairs explain why the amounts of guanine and cytosine are present in equal amounts, as are the amounts of adenine and thymine. Adenine and guanine are known as purines . These bases consist of two ring structures. Purines make up one of the two groups of nitrogenous bases. Thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines , which have just one ring structure. By having a purine always combine with a pyrimidine in the DNA double helix, the distance between the two sugar-phosphate backbones is constant, maintaining the uniform shape of the DNA molecule.





Anti-parallel Strands


The two strands in the DNA backbone run in "anti-parallel" directions to each other. That is, one of the DNA strands is built in the 5' → 3' direction, while the complementary strand is built in the 3' → 5' direction. In the DNA backbone, the sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugars. In a double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand. 5' and 3' each mark one end of a strand. A strand running in the 5' → 3' direction that has adenine will pair with base thymine on the complementary strand running in 3' → 5' direction.



Figure 9.8

The base-pairing nature of DNA. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and they are held together with two hydrogen bonds. The guanine-cytosine base pair is held together with three hydrogen bonds. Note that one sugar-phosphate backbone is in the 5’ → 3’ direction, with the other strand in the opposite 3’ → 5’ orientation. Notice that the 5'-end begins with a free (not attached to the sugar of another nucleotide) phosphate group, while the 3'-end has a free (not attached to the phosphate group of another nucleotide) deoxyribose sugar.





Four Letter Code


DNA is made of a four letter code, made of just As, Cs, Gs, and Ts, that determines what the organism will become and what it will look like. How can these four bases carry so much information? This information results from the order of these four bases in the chromosomes. This sequence carries the unique genetic information for each species and each individual. Humans have about 3,000,000,000 bits of this information in each cell; 3 billion bases in the genome . A gorilla may also have close to that amount of information, but a slightly different sequence. For example, the sequence 5'-AGGTTTACCAGT-3' will have different information than 5'-CAAGGGATTACT-3'. The closer the evolutionary relationship is between two species, the more similar their DNA sequences will be. For example, the DNA sequences between two species of reptiles will be more similar than between a reptile and an elm tree.

DNA sequences can be used for scientific, medical, and forensic purposes. DNA sequences can be used to establish evolutionary relationships between species, to determine a person’s susceptibility to inherit or develop a certain disease, or to identify crime suspects or victims. Of course, DNA analysis can be used for other purposes as well. So why is DNA so useful for these purposes? It is useful because every cell in an organism has the same DNA sequence. For this to occur, each cell must have a mechanism to copy its entire DNA. How can so much information be exactly copied in such a small amount of time?

The structure of DNA is discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-vZ_g7K6P0 (28:05). Protein synthesis, which is the focus of the next lesson, is also discussed in this video.

DNA Replication - Advanced


Describe how DNA is replicated.

Explain the importance of the fact that during DNA replication, each strand serves as a template to make a complementary DNA strand.





What do you need to copy?

Obviously, you need something to copy. The same is true for DNA. To copy or replicate DNA, you use both strands as templates.





DNA Replication


DNA replication is the process in which a cell’s entire DNA is copied, or replicated. The identification of the structure of DNA suggested that each strand of the double helix would serve as a template for synthesis of a new strand. DNA replication process occurs during the Synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. As each DNA strand has the same genetic information, both strands of the double helix can serve as templates for the reproduction of a complementary new strand. The two resulting double helices, which each contain one "old" strand and one "new" strand of DNA, are identical to the initial double helix. DNA replication is said to be semi-conservative because of this process of replication, where the resulting double helix is composed of both an old strand and a new strand.

For an animation of DNA replication, see http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/media/DNAi_replication_vo1-sm.mov .



Figure 9.9

DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands “unzip”, and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand. The replication fork is obvious at the point of separation of the double helix.



The semi-conservative mechanism of replication was one of three models originally proposed for DNA replication:

Semiconservative replication would produce two copies that each contained one of the original strands and one new strand.

Conservative replication would leave the two original template DNA strands together in a double helix, with the new DNA composed entirely of two new strands.

Dispersive replication would produce two copies of the DNA, both containing a mixture of old and new material.



Of these three models, the semi-conservative model seemed most reasonable since it would allow each new daughter strand to remain associated with its template strand. The semiconservative model was confirmed by the Meselson-Stahl experiment.



Figure 9.10

DNA replication is a semi-conservative process. Half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules.





The Meselson-Stahl Experiment


In 1958, Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl identified evidence that supported the hypothesis that DNA replication was semiconservative. The experiment took advantage of the fact that nitrogen is a major constituent of DNA, and that two forms of nitrogen are available: 14 N and a heavier isotope, 15 N. The DNA of cells grown in 15 N medium have a higher density than cells grown in normal 14 N medium. The experiment was performed as follows:

E. coli were grown for several generations in a medium with 15 N.

After that, E. coli cells with only 15 N in their DNA were transferred to a 14 N medium and were allowed to divide.

After one round of replication, DNA was isolated and was compared to pure 14 N DNA and 15 N DNA. After one round of DNA replication, the resulting DNA was found to have close to the intermediate density between 14 N labelled DNA and 15 N labelled DNA. Since conservative replication would result in equal amounts of DNA of the 15 N and 14 N densities, but no DNA of an intermediate density, the conservative replication model was excluded. However, this result was still consistent with both semiconservative and dispersive replication. Semiconservative replication would result in double-stranded DNA having an intermediate density, with one strand of 15 N DNA and one of 14 N DNA. Dispersive replication would result in double-stranded DNA also of an intermediate density, with both strands having mixtures of 15 N and 14 N DNA.

The cells were then allowed to progress through another round of DNA replication in the 14 N medium. DNA from cells after two replications had been completed was found to consist of equal amounts of DNA with both an intermediate density and a lower density. This was inconsistent with the dispersive replication model, which would have resulted in a single density, lower than the intermediate density of the one-replication cells, but still higher than cells grown only in 14 N DNA medium, as the original 15 N DNA would have been split evenly among all DNA strands. The result was consistent with the semiconservative replication hypothesis. See A half DNA ladder is a template for copying the whole at http://www.dnaftb.org/20/animation.html to see Meselson and Stahl talk about their work.





Helicase and Polymerase


DNA replication begins as an enzyme, DNA helicase , breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two strands together and forms a replication fork . The resulting structure has two branching strands of DNA backbone with exposed bases. These exposed bases allow the DNA to be “read” by another enzyme, DNA polymerase , which then builds the complementary DNA strand. As DNA helicase continues to open the double helix, the replication fork grows.





5' → 3


The two new strands of DNA are “built” in opposite directions, through either a leading strand or a lagging strand . The leading strand is the DNA strand that DNA polymerase constructs in the 5' → 3' direction. This strand of DNA is made in a continuous manner, moving as the replication fork grows. The lagging strand is the DNA strand at the opposite side of the replication fork from the leading strand. It goes in the opposite direction, from 3' to 5'. DNA polymerase cannot build a strand in the 3' → 5' direction. Thus, this "lagging” strand is synthesized in short segments known as Okazaki fragments . On the lagging strand, an enzyme known as primase builds a short RNA primer. DNA polymerase is then able to use the free 3'-OH group on the RNA primer to make DNA in the 5' → 3' direction. The RNA fragments are then degraded and new DNA nucleotides are added to fill the gaps where the RNA was present. Another enzyme, DNA ligase , is then able to attach (ligate) the DNA nucleotides together, completing the synthesis of the lagging strand ( Figure below ).



Figure 9.11

DNA replication. The two DNA strands are opened by helicase. The strands are held open by a single strand of binding proteins, preventing premature reannealing. Topoisomerase solves the problem caused by tension generated by winding/unwinding of DNA. This enzyme wraps around DNA and makes a cut permitting the helix to spin and relax. Once DNA is relaxed, topoisomerase reconnects broken strands. DNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer which initiates the Okazaki fragment. Okazaki fragments are attached by DNA ligase.



Many replication forks develop along a chromosome. This process continues until the replication forks meet, and the all of the DNA in a chromosome has been copied. Each new strand that has formed is complementary to the strand used as the template. Each resulting DNA molecule is identical to the original DNA molecule. During prophase of mitosis or prophase I of meiosis, these molecules of DNA condense into a chromosome made of two identical "sister" chromatids. This process ensures that cells that result from cell division have identical sets of genetic material, and that the DNA is an exact copy of the parent cell’s DNA.

What is RNA?

RNA, the other nucleic acid. RNA has many important functions, especially during protein synthesis. And what allows it to be involved in protein synthesis is its ability to fold into three-dimensional structures, giving the molecule specific functions. This structure depicts an RNA molecule. the numerous secondary structures, such as the helices, are visible.





RNA


DNA → RNA → Protein

The central dogma of molecular biology. “DNA makes RNA makes protein.” So what exactly is RNA? Ribonucleic acid , or RNA , is the other important nucleic acid in this three player act. When we say that “DNA makes RNA makes protein,” what do we mean? We mean that the information in DNA is somehow transferred into RNA, and that the information in RNA is then used to make the protein. But is all of the information in DNA transferred to RNA? Or just some of the information?

Recall that a gene is a segment of DNA that contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein. These genes are embedded within the DNA in the nucleus. This DNA never leaves the nucleus. So, how does the information get from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the ribosomes are? Remember that the ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis . To understand this, it helps to first understand RNA.

Keep in mind that even though you have many thousands of genes, not all are used in every cell type. In fact, probably only a few thousand are used in a particular type of cell, with different cell types using different genes. However, while these genes are embedded in the large chromosomes that never leave the nucleus, the RNA is relatively small and is easily able to carry information out of the nucleus. This process occurs when the gene product is needed by the cell. If all genes were "expressed" all the time in every cell, then all cells would be very similar, and it would be a tremendous waste of energy. Instead, gene expression occurs only when the gene product is required by the cell. This process begins with the information in a gene being transcribed into an RNA molecule, a process called transcription.



Figure 9.12

Gene Expression. Shown is the process beginning with the DNA molecule in the nucleus and ending with the protein in the cytoplasm. Transcription produces the mRNA molecule, which carries the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.





Vocabulary

gene expression : The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) : Single-stranded nucleic acid; involved in protein synthesis.

RNA Structure - Advanced


Describe the structure and function of RNA.





Protein or RNA molecule?

Actually both. This represents the chemical structure of the ribosome of Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . It is made of both protein and RNA. The RNA in this ribosome, though, has protein-like properties. RNAs are able to fold back onto themselves, folding into three-dimensional structures with functional properties. Sometimes these are enzymatic properties, such as those found in the ribosome.





RNA Structure


RNA structure differs from DNA structure in three specific ways. Both are nucleic acids and made out of nucleotides ; however, RNA is single stranded while DNA is double stranded. RNA nucleotides, like those from DNA, have three parts: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a base. RNA contains the 5-carbon sugar ribose , whereas in DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose. The difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the lack of a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position of deoxyribose.

Though both RNA and DNA contain the nitrogenous bases adenine, guanine and cytosine, RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil instead of thymine. Uracil pairs with adenine in RNA, just as thymine pairs with adenine in DNA. Uracil and thymine have very similar structures; uracil is an unmethylated form of thymine.

The nucleotide sequence of RNA, which is complementary to the DNA sequence, allows RNA to encode genetic information. RNA though carries the genetic information of just one gene. Hence, compared to DNA, RNA molecules are relatively small.

A comparison of RNA and DNA is shown in the Table below and Figure below .

Specific Base contains uracil contains thymine

Size relatively small big (chromosomes)

Location moves to cytoplasm stays in nucleus

Types 3 types: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA generally 1 type

A comparison of RNA and DNA. RNA is single stranded and contains the base uracil, which replaces thymine.





RNA Activity


Analysis of RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, most RNAs, though single-stranded, do form specific secondary structures. Like proteins, the folded structure of the RNA is specific and gives the RNA functional properties. Some RNAs contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. RNA nucleotides base-pair like DNA nucleotides, however in DNA, this base-pairing is necessary to form the double helix structure uniform to all DNA. In RNA, the base pairs would be A-U and G-C pairings. The base pairing in RNA is unique to each molecule of RNA and results in a three-dimensional structure that gives each molecule functional properties. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices but rather collections of short helices combined into a functional molecule. Because of the structure of RNA, the RNA molecule can achieve biochemical catalysis, similar to that of enzymes. For instance, the structure of the ribosome allows peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. The active site of the ribosome is composed entirely of RNA.





Vocabulary

protein synthesis : The process in which cells make proteins; includes transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA.

RNA Types - Advanced


Discuss the role of the three main types of RNA: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA.





How does the information move from the nucleus, where the DNA is located, to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are?

RNA, the other nucleic acid, that's how. Specifically mRNA or messenger RNA. RNA, the middle player in the central dogma. This image is an abstract representation of transfer RNA, which brings the amino acid to the ribosome. Without tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA, proteins cannot be made.





Types of RNAs


So what is the role of? We know that RNA is the middle player in the central dogma of molecular biology, but is that all it does?

There are three types of RNA involved in protein synthesis: messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribisomal RNA (rRNA). All three of these nucleic acids work together to produce a protein. The mRNA takes the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located. Ribosomes are the organelles where the proteins are made. The ribosomes themselves are made out of rRNA and other proteins. The mRNA binds to the ribosome, bringing the genetic instructions to order the amino acids to the site of protein synthesis. Finally, the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome ( Figure below and Figure below ). In mRNA, the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and U) are arranged into codons of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except for the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis. tRNA, which has a specific “3-leaf clover structure,” contains a three base region called the anticodon , which can base pair to the corresponding three-base codon region on mRNA. More will be discussed on these processes in the Protein Synthesis: The Genetic Code (Advanced) and Protein Synthesis: Translation (Advanced) concepts.





Three RNAs


Remember that proteins are made out of amino acids. How does the information in the gene get converted from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids? The process is called translation . The amino acids are placed in a specific order during translation. The order is specified by the codons in the mRNA, which is produced during transcription. As the mRNA sequence is based on the gene sequence in the DNA, the order of amino acids that makes the protein is based on the gene sequence as well.

The three RNAs involved in protein synthesis are summarized here:

mRNA (messenger RNA): Produced during transcription. Carries the genetic instructions of a gene from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm.

rRNA (ribosomal RNA): Together with proteins, composes the ribosome, the organelles that are the site of protein synthesis.

tRNA (transfer RNA): Brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome during translation.





Figure 9.14

2-Dimensional tRNA structure depicting the 3-leaf clover structure. The D arm (D) is one stem ending in a loop. The anticodon arm (A) is a second stem whose loop contains the anticodon on the bottom of the tRNA. The T arm (T) is the third stem opposite the D arm.





Figure 9.15

3-Dimensional representation of a tRNA. Coloring: CCA tail in orange, Acceptor stem in purple, D arm in red, Anticodon arm in blue with Anticodon in black, and T arm in green. The acceptor stem is made by the base pairing of the 5'-terminal nucleotide with the 3'-terminal nucleotide. The CCA tail is a CCA sequence at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule, used to attach the amino acid. This sequence is important for the recognition of tRNA by enzymes critical in translation.





Other RNAs


Small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) are other types of RNA. siRNA and miRNA are revolutionizing molecular biology, developmental biology, and even medicine. The 2006 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Dr. Andrew Fire and Dr. Craig Mello for their discovery of siRNA, which is a type of double-stranded RNA that inhibits gene expression at the mRNA level. siRNAs are usually 20-25 nucleotides in length. Specifically, siRNA acts on processed mRNA by targeting it for degradation. siRNA is responsible for RNA interference (RNAi) where it interferes with the expression of specific genes with nucleotide sequences complementary to the siRNA. RNAi has a natural role in that it is used by plants in defense against plant viral RNAs.



Figure 9.16

Mediating RNA interference. siRNAs are transcribed and then processed by the enzyme Dicer, an endoribonuclease in the RNase III family. This enzyme cleaves double-stranded RNA and pre-microRNA into short double-stranded siRNA RNA fragments. These can then bind to mRNA and target the mRNA for degradation.



miRNAs are also involved in the regulation of gene expression. They are transcribed but not translated into proteins. snRNAs are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. They are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing (removal of introns), and regulation of transcription factors, proteins involved in turning on or off genes.





Vocabulary


anticodon : A three base sequence on the tRNA molecule complementary to the codon on the mRNA.



codon : A sequence of three nucleotides within mRNA; encodes for a specific amino acid or termination (stop) sequence.



mRNA : Messenger RNA; serves as a nucleic acid intermediate between the nucleus and the ribosomes.



ribosome : A non-membrane bound organelle inside all cells; site of protein synthesis (translation).



rRNA : Ribosomal RNA; together with proteins, forms ribosomes.



stop codon : A codon that does not have a corresponding tRNA (does not code for an amino acid); signals the end of translation; also known as a termination codon; UAG, UGA, and UAA.



transcription : The process of making mRNA from the information in the DNA (gene) sequence.



translation : The process of synthesizing a polypeptide/protein from the information in a mRNA sequence; occurs on ribosomes.



tRNA : Transfer RNA; brings an amino acid to the ribosome.





Summary


There are three types of RNA: mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

Protein Synthesis - Advanced


Discuss the meaning of DNA → RNA → Protein.

Describe types of genetic information transfer.





Is it always DNA to RNA to proteins?

The central dogma of molecular biology. Coined by Francis Crick. And in his own words, "I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful."





DNA → RNA → Protein


If DNA never leaves the nucleus, and ribosomes are in the cytoplasm, how does “DNA makes RNA makes protein” actually happen? The two processes necessary to make a protein from the information in DNA are transcription and translation. Transcription, which happens in the nucleus, uses the DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule. The RNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to the cytoplasm where translation occurs on a ribosome and produces a protein. In RNA is an intermediary between DNA and protein at http://www.dnaftb.org/21/animation.html , Francis Crick speaks about this process.

The central dogma of molecular biology was first described by Francis Crick, who with James Watson first described the structure of DNA, in 1958 and re-stated in a Nature paper published in 1970. He stated that, "The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid." This central dogma explains the molecular transfer of sequence information. It was simplified by Marshall Nirenberg, the scientist who cracked the genetic code , who said, "DNA makes RNA makes protein."

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the fundamental process that makes us all different. We all essentially have the same genes and proteins. Though we have the same genes, we have different alleles of those genes. And though we may have the same proteins, such as we have the protein collagen found in bones, many of our proteins are slightly different and thus work slightly differently. If all our proteins acted the same way, we would all be exactly the same. Our proteins are slightly different because we have different alleles. Those alleles are what makes us unique. They are our particle version of the genetic instructions. It is those small difference in the DNA sequence of different alleles that is translated into small differences in the mRNA molecules. And those differences in the mRNAs are then translated into proteins. And those small differences in the order of amino acids in proteins are enough to make us all different.

See One gene makes one protein at http://www.dnaftb.org/16/animation.html to see Geoege Beadle describe his and Edward Tatum's work.

Transfer of Sequence Information


The polymers that comprise DNA, RNA and amino acids are linear polymers. Each monomer (a nucleotide or amino acid) is connected to, at most, two other monomers. The sequence of their monomers encodes genetic information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma based on the order of monomers that make this genetic information. The polymer's (DNA or RNA) sequence is used as a template for the construction of another polymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original polymer's sequence. The DNA sequence is used to encode RNA, and the RNA sequence is used to encode protein. Are those the only transfers of genetic information?

With three biopolymers (DNA, RNA, and protein), there could be as many as nine potential types of transfers. The central dogma classes these into three groups of three

three general transfers,

three special transfers,

three unknown transfers.



The three general transfers are believed to occur normally in most cells. These describe the normal flow of biological information. DNA is replicated, DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein. The three special transfers are known to occur under special conditions, such as with some viruses. The three unknown transfers are not believed to occur.

The 3 classes of information transfer suggested by the central dogma General Special Unknown

Reverse Transcription


Reverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA. The is the reverse of normal transcription. Reverse transcription occurs in retroviruses, such as HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Retroviruses are RNA viruses that are duplicated in a host cell by using reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome.

Reverse transcription also occurs with retrotransposons and during telomere synthesis in eukaryotes. Retrotransposons are self-replicating segments of eukaryotic genomes that use reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via a RNA intermediate. A telomere is a region of repetitive noncoding nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome. These sequences protect the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. Each time DNA is replicated, small segments of DNA from the ends of the chromosome is lost. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that uses an RNA intermediate to elongate the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions after each replication cycle.





RNA Replication


RNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another. Many RNA viruses copy their RNA using RNA replication. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are the enzymes specific for this process, as opposed DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is also known as RNA replicase. These enzymes are found in many eukaryotic cells, where they are involved in RNA silencing. RNA silencing refers to mechanisms of gene silencing, in which the expression of one or more genes is downregulated or entirely suppressed by the binding of an antisense RNA molecule. An antisense RNA molecule is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a mRNA strand transcribed within a cell. These two RNAs bind to each other and prevent translation. RNA interference is a form of gene silencing.

Transcription - Advanced


Describe how transcription makes RNA from a DNA template.





How does a cell use the information in its DNA?

To transcribe means "to paraphrase or summarize in writing." The information in DNA is transcribed - or summarized - into a smaller version - RNA - that can be used by the cell. This process is called transcription. Only certain specific "segments" - genes - in the DNA are transcribed at any one time.





Transcription


Transcription is “DNA → RNA.” In other words, transcription is the transfer of the genetic instructions from DNA to RNA. During transcription, a complementary copy of RNA is made. Whereas in DNA replication both strands of the DNA double helix are used as templates, in transcription only one strand is needed. RNA polymerase enzymatically “reads” a template strand of DNA, known as the coding strand, to synthesize the complementary RNA strand. Transcription is usually divided into 3 stages, appropriately named initiation, elongation and termination. In eukaryotes, transcription can be additionally divided into 5 stages: preinitiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation and termination.

For an animation of transcription, see http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/media/DNAi_transcription_vo1-sm.mov .



Figure 9.17

Overview of Transcription. Transcription uses the sequence of bases in a strand of DNA to make a complementary strand of mRNA. Triplets are groups of three successive nucleotide bases in DNA. Codons are complementary groups of bases in mRNA. Every triplet, or codon, encodes for a unique amino acid.





PreInitiation


In eukaryotes, preinitiation of transcription is a step that determines if transcription will proceed. This step is involved in the regulation of gene expression, and will be further discussed in those concepts. The process is also highly regulated in prokaryotic cells, but is a much less complicated process than that in eukaryotic cells.

Briefly, during preinitiation, RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence in the presence of specific transcription factors. RNA polymerase II , and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. The TATA box is a highly characterized core promoter sequence found in most eukaryotic promoters. The TATA box is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). Only after this factor and a number of other factors bind to this complex can RNA polymerase complete the preinitiation complex and initiate transcription. The rate of transcription is modulated by additional activators and repressors.

The complete preinitiation complex contains:

the core promoter sequence

various transcription factors

RNA polymerase

activators and repressors.





RNA Polymerase


RNA polymerase, which is also known as DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is an enzyme that produces RNA using a DNA template. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential to life and are found in all organisms. In biochemical terms, RNA polymerase is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. While bacteria have one type of RNA polymerase, eukaryotes have multiple types, each responsible for the sun thesis of a distinct set of RNAs.

RNA polymerase I synthesizes a pre-rRNA 45S, which matures into 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs which will form the major RNA components of the ribosome.

RNA polymerase II synthesizes mRNAs and most snRNA and microRNAs. Due to the high level of regulation needed for proper transcription, a wide range of transcription factors is necessary for RNA polymerase II to bind to a gene's promoter. These will be discussed in the Regulation of Gene Expression (Advanced) concepts.

RNA polymerase III synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other small RNAs.

RNA polymerases IV and V synthesize siRNA in plants.





Initiation


Initiation of transcription only occurs when all transcription factors are aligned along the promoter correctly. Transcription factors are usually proteins that bind to the DNA sequence of the promoter. Once all these factors are in place, RNA polymerase can begin transcription.

Transcription begins with the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter of a gene. An eukaryotic promoter signals the approximate start of a gene. The promoter usually includes specific sequences that are recognized by transcription factors, which are proteins that aid in the binding of RNA polymerase to the correct place on the DNA. The transcription initiation complex formed by the promoter, transcription factors, and RNA polymerase signals the start, or initiation, of transcription. The DNA unwinds as the hydrogen bonds between the bases are broken, and produces a small open complex, which allows RNA polymerase to “read” the DNA template and begin the synthesis of RNA.



Figure 9.18

Initiation. Notice that a set of transcription factors must bind to the promoter in the proper orientation prior to RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding and initiating transcription.





Promoter Clearance


Soon after initiation the RNA polymerase must clear the promoter. During this time the transcriptional process is unstable. There is a tendency for the complex to release the RNA transcript and produce truncated unstable messages. This is called abortive initiation and is common for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This process can continue until the the transcription elongation complex is formed. Once the newly synthesized mRNA transcript reaches approximately 23 nucleotides long, abortive initiation is no longer and issue and elongation will continue until termination. This, like most of the remainder of transcription, is an energy-dependent process, consuming ATP.





Elongation


Transcription elongation involves the further addition of RNA nucleotides and the change to a transcriptional complex. As the RNA transcript is assembled, DNA in front of RNA polymerase unwinds by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the bases, and transcription continues. As transcription progresses, RNA nucleotides are added to the 3' end of the growing RNA transcript. The DNA template (non-coding) strand is read in the 3' → 5' direction, so the complementary RNA stand in created in the 5' → 3' direction. This produces an RNA molecule from 5' → 3', an exact copy of genetic instructions in the DNA coding strand. Of course the newly made RNA is composed of RNA nucleotides with uracil bases and ribose sugars.

The transcriptional complex has a short DNA-RNA hybrid, an 8 base-pair stretch in which the newly made RNA is temporarily hydrogen bonded to the DNA template strand. Once the hydrogen bonds are broken, the RNA is released from the DNA transcription complex. Unlike DNA replication, mRNA transcription can involve multiple RNA polymerases, allowing numerous mRNAs to be produced from a single copy of the gene. This step also involves a proofreading mechanism that can replace an incorrectly added RNA nucleotide.



Figure 9.19

Elongation. As RNA polymerase reads the template strand, the mRNA is synthesized. Notice that a few of the RNA nucleotides are temporarily hydrogen bonded to the DNA nucleotides.





Termination


The termination of transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is very different. Though both involve the detachment of the RNA from the DNA template, how this occurs is surprisingly distinct. Bacteria use two different strategies for transcription termination, Rho-dependent and Rho-independent termination. In Rho-dependent termination , a protein factor called "Rho" destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid, releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex. In Rho-independent termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a hairpin loop followed by a run of uracils. This structure is the signal for the detachment of the RNA from the DNA. The DNA is now ready for translation.

The termination of transcription in eukaryotes is less well understood. The RNA polymerase transcribes a polyadenylation signal. Polyadenylation is the addition of a string of A’s to the mRNA’s 3’ end and will be discussed in the Protein Synthesis: mRNA (Advanced) concept. However, soon after the transcription of this signal, proteins cut the RNA transcript free from the RNA polymerase and the enzyme eventually falls off the DNA. This process produces a pre-mRNA, an mRNA that is not quite ready to be translated.

Messenger RNA - Advanced


Explain the various types of modification mRNA undergoes before translation.

Discuss mRNA splicing and define introns and exons.





Why a lasso?

A lariat can refer to a rope in the form of a lasso. But it is also a genetic structure involved in splicing.





Eukaryotic mRNA Processing


Following transcription an mRNA is produced. However, newly transcribed eukaryotic mRNA is not ready for translation. This mRNA requires extensive processing, and so is known as pre-mRNA . The modification processes include splicing, the addition of a 5’ cap, editing, and polyadenylation. Once these process have occurred, the mature mRNA can be exported through the nuclear pore to the cytoplasm.



Figure 9.21





Splicing


Humans have approximately 22,000 genes, yet make many more proteins. How? A process called alternative splicing allows one mRNA to produce many polypeptides. To understand this concept, the structure of the pre-mRNA must be discussed.

Eukaryotic pre-mRNA contains introns and exons. An exon is the region of a gene that contains the code for producing a protein. Most genes contain many exons, with each exon containing the information for a specific portion of a complete protein. In many species, a gene's exons are separated by long regions of DNA that have no identified function. These long regions are introns , and must be removed prior to translation. Splicing is the process by which introns are removed ( Figure below ). Sometimes a process called alternative splicing allows pre-mRNA messages to be spliced in several different configurations, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins. Splicing is usually performed by an RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome , but some RNA molecules have their own catalytic activity and are capable of acting like enzymes to catalyze their own splicing. Bacterial mRNAs do not have introns.

For an animation of RNA splicing, see http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/mrnasplicing/first.htm .



Figure 9.22

Splicing. Splicing removes introns from mRNA. UTR is an untranslated region of the mRNA. Ribonucleoproteins are nucleoproteins that contains RNA. Small nuclear ribonuclearproteins are involved in pre-mRNA splicing.





Exon Skipping


One example of alternative splicing is with exon skipping. The D. melanogaster (fruit fly) doublesex (dsx) gene is involved in the fly's determination system. Pre-mRNAs from this gene contain 6 eons, numbered 1-6. In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are spliced together to form the mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein required for male development. In females, exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 are joined, and a polyadenylation signal in exon 4 causes cleavage of the mRNA at that point. The resulting mRNA is a transcriptional regulatory protein required for female development.





Lariat Structures


Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involves a two-step biochemical process. Both steps involve reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides. First, the 2'-OH of a exon-intron junction nucleotide within the intron binds to the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site, forming an intermediate known as a lariat . Second, the 3'-OH of the released 5' exon then binds to the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.



Figure 9.23

The two-step chemistry of mRNA splicing.





5' cap Addition


How does the mRNA know it is time to leave the nucleus? Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, how does it find a ribosome? A signal on the front, 5’-end of the mRNA helps with both jobs. This signal is the 5’ cap . The 5' cap is a modified guanine nucleotide ( a 7-methylguanosine) added to the 5’-end of the pre-mRNA soon after the start of transcription. This 5’ cap is crucial for recognition and proper attachment of the mRNA to the ribosome, as well as protection from exonucleases, enzymes that degrade nucleic acids. Specifically the 5' cap adds stability from RNases. The process of 5' capping is vital to creating mature messenger RNA prior to translation.

The cap is also known as a 7-methylguanosine cap, abbreviated m 7 G.



Figure 9.24

5' (7-methylguanosine) cap structure.





Editing


In certain instances, the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA will be changed to allow the mRNA to produce multiple proteins. This process is called editing . The classic example is editing of the apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA in humans. APOB is a protein that is responsible for carrying cholesterol to tissues. It is the primary lipoprotein of LDL (low density lipoprotein).

The APOB protein occurs in the plasma in two main forms, APOB48 and APOB100. APOB48 has 48% of the molecular weight has APOB100. The first is synthesized exclusively by the small intestine, the second by the liver. Both proteins are coded for by the same gene, which is transcribed into a single pre-mRNA. Editing changes a C to a U in the mRNA, changing a CAA codon (Glutamine) to a UAA codon, which is a premature (early) stop codon. Hence, upon translation this base change results in a smaller protein. As a result of the RNA editing, APOB48 and APOB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, but APOB48 lacks APOB100's C-terminal region. APOB48 contains only the first 2152 amino acids of the full-length 4536 amino acid APOB100.





Polyadenylation


In eukaryotic cells, the transcription of the polyadenylation signals indicates the termination of the process. The mRNA transcript is then cut off of the RNA polymerase and freed from the DNA. The cleavage site is characterized by the presence of the sequence AAUAAA near the end of the transcribed message. Polyadenylation then occurs. Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3’-end of the mRNA. The poly(A) tail may consist of as many as 80 to 250 adenosine residues. The poly(A) tail protects the mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Poladenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. For an animation on RNA polyadenylation, see http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/mrnaprocessing/first.htm.

The Genetic Code - Advanced


Explain how the Genetic Code is a three letter code, and describe its role in translating nucleotides into amino acids.

Explain that a reading frame is the group of three bases in which the mRNA is read, and describe how interrupting the reading frame may have severe consequences on the protein.

Discuss what is meant by the universal genetic code.





How do you go from four nucleotide letters to 20 amino acids?

You need a code. And the code that changes the information embedded in DNA and RNA into ordered amino acids and proteins is the genetic code. And every living organism uses the same genetic code.





The Genetic Code


So how exactly is the language of nucleotides used to code for the language of amino acids? How can a code of only As, Cs, Gs, and Us carry information for 20 different amino acids? The genetic code is the code in which the language of nucleotides is used to create the language of amino acids.





Cracking the Code


A code of at least three letters has to be the answer. A one letter code would only be able to code for four amino acids. A two letter code could only code for 16 amino acids. With a three letter code, there are 64 possibilities. As there are 20 amino acids, the code must consist of at least three letters.

In 1961, Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner demonstrated the presence of codons , that is, three bases of RNA that code for one amino acid ( Figure below ). Also in 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) demonstrated that a poly(U) RNA sequence was translated into a polypeptide consisting of only the amino acid phenylalanine. This proved that the codon UUU coded for the amino acid phenylalanine. Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of 54 of the 64 codons. Others determined the remainder of the genetic code ( Figure below ). In DNA words are three letters long at http://www.dnaftb.org/22/animation.html , Nirenberg talks about cracking the genetic code.



Figure 9.25

The mRNA is divided into three-base segments called codons. A codon is the segment of nucleotides that codes for an amino acid, or for a start or stop signal. There are 64 codons.





Figure 9.26

The Genetic Code. The Genetic Code: Codons are in the mRNA sequence. The three letter and one letter code for the amino acids are shown. To read the code, find the first base on the left, the second base at the top, and the third base in the center of the table. For example, the codon GGG codes for the amino acid glycine (as does GGC, GGA, and GGU), CCG codes for Proline, UUA codes for Leucine, and AAG codes for Lysine. There are 64 codons that code for 20 amino acids and three stop codons, so an amino acid may have more than one corresponding codon.





Start and Stop Codons


The codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine. This codon is also the start codon which begins every translation of every amino acid chain. The translational machinery “reads” the mRNA base by base until a AUG start codon is identified. The mRNA is then translated codon by codon until it reaches a stop codon . Stop codons are not associated with a tRNA or amino acid and signal the end of translation. There are three stop codons: UAG, UGA, UAA. Stop codons are also known as termination codons.





The Reading Frame


The reading frame is the frame of three bases in which the mRNA is read and translated. Every sequence can be read in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence. For example, in the sequence GCAUGGGGGUCUAG, the reading frame can begin with either the first G, the first C, or the first A. As stated above, translation starts with the start codon which consists of the three bases AUG. Each subsequent codon is translated until an "in-frame" stop codon is reached. In the example above, the polypeptide sequence would be: methionine – glycine – valine – stop.

Mutations that disrupt the reading frame by insertions or deletions of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations . Take the example THEBIGFATCATATETHEREDRAT.

Broken into codons, this example would be easily read as: THE BIG FAT CAT ATE THE RED RAT.

However, a deletion mutation that disrupts the reading frame, results in a message that does not make any sense.

If the ‘B’ is deleted: THE IGF ATC ATA TET HER EDR AT.

Once the reading frame is disrupted, the mRNA may not be translated properly. Different amino acids would be inserted into the protein. These mutations may impair the function of the resulting protein, if the protein is even formed. Many frameshift mutations result in a premature stop codon, in other words, a stop codon that come earlier than normal during translation. This would result in a smaller protein, most likely without normal function. Keep in mind that not all mutations are harmful; some are beneficial. Evolution would not occur without these beneficial mutations.





The Wobble Hypothesis


In 1966, Francis Crick proposed the Wobble Hypothesis which explained that the degeneracy of the genetic code is caused by the structure of the anticodon of tRNA. The anticodon is a three base sequence on the tRNA complementary to the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA binds to a specific amino acid, but the anticodons of some tRNA molecules can bind to two or three different codons. This flexibility of the anticodon is caused by the less stringent 5' base on the anticodon loop, also referred to as the wobble base, which binds to the 3' base on the mRNA. Only the first two nucleotides are stringent and spatially confined for the decoding of the mRNA codon into an amino acid. This explains why degenerate codons often differ in the third position, as depicted in Figure above . For example, the amino acid alanine is coded by codons GCU, GCC, GCA and GCG. The wobble movement of the base in the 5' anticodon position is necessary for this degenerate capability.

The Wobble Hypothesis states that rules of base pairing are relaxed at the third position, so that a base can pair with more than one complementary base. The hypothesis explains why the base inosine is included in position 1 in the anticodons of various tRNAs, why many mRNA codon words translate to a single amino acid, why there are appreciably fewer tRNAs than mRNA codon types and why the redundant nature of the genetic code translates into a precise set of 20 amino acids.

A wobble base pair is a non-Watson Crick base pairing between two nucleotides in RNA molecules. The four main wobble base pairs are guanine-uracil, inocine-uracil, inosine-adenine, and inosine-cytosine. Wobble base pairs are fundamental in RNA secondary structure and are critical for the proper translation of the genetic code. Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed from the hydrolytic deamination of adenine. Structurally, it resembles guanine, but lacks the 2-amino group. This lack of the 2-amino group allows inosine to form base pairs with uracil, cytosine and adenine, making it a particularly wobbly base.





Degeneracy of the Universal Genetic Code


When there are 64 codon combinations for 20 amino acids (and stop codons), there is going to be some overlap. Within the genetic code there is redundancy but no ambiguity. For example, the codons GGG, GGA, GGC, and GGU all encode the amino acid glycine, but none encode another amino acid. Degenerate codons often differ in the third position.

The genetic code is said to be universal. That is, the same code is utilized by the simplest prokaryotic organism and by humans. This universality is a tremendous benefit to mankind. If a human gene is placed in a bacteria, it looks just like a piece of DNA to the bacteria. The human As, Cs, Gs, and Ts look just like the bacteria’s As, Cs, Gs, and Ts. So, the bacterial proteins will transcribe and translate this DNA, making a human protein.

But how exactly are these proteins made? We have been referring to mRNAs, tRNAs, ribosomes, codons the genetic code and transcription and translation throughout the concepts. How do they all come together to make a protein? Through translation.

Translation - Advanced


Describe translation. Explain that translation is the process of ordering the amino acids into a polypeptide; translation involves changing the language of nucleotides into the language of amino acids.

Illustrate the process of translation, describing how mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA all work together to complete the process.

Discuss what happens to the polypeptide after translation.





RNA to proteins. How?

You must translate. To go from one language to another. Spanish to English, French to German, or nucleotides to amino acids. Which type is the translation of molecular biology? Obviously, the type of translating discussed here translates from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids.





Translation


Translation is “RNA → protein.” In other words, translation is the transfer of the genetic instructions in RNA to a protein made of amino acids. Translation uses the products of transcription, mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, to convert the mRNA sequence into a polypeptide according to the genetic code. The mRNA moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to interact with a ribosome , which serves as the site of translation. Translation proceeds in three phases: initiation , elongation and termination .

To understand translation, first we need to understand the ribosome. Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, a small subunit and a larger subunit. Prokaryotic subunits are named the 30S and 50S subunits; eukaryotic subunits are named the 40S and 60S subunits. During translation the tRNA molecules are literally “inside” the ribosomal subunits, as they sit on the mRNA strand. When tRNAs come to the ribosome, adjacent amino acids are brought together, allowing the ribosome to catalyze the formation of the peptide bond between amino acids. The ribosome has three tRNA binding sites: the A site, the P site, and the E site ( Figure below ). The A site binds a tRNA with an attached amino acid. The P site contains the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain attached, and the E site contains the tRNA that no longer has an attached amino acid. This tRNA is preparing to exit the ribosome. A single mRNA can be translated simultaneously by multiple ribosomes.

For an animation of translation, see http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/media/DNAi_translation_vo1-sm.mov .



Figure 9.27

This cartoon depicts the relative location of the E, P, and A sites within the ribosome. The A site binds a tRNA bound to an amino acid, the P site binds a tRNA bound to the polypeptide being synthesized, and the E site binds a tRNA without an attached amino acid before the tRNA exits the ribosome.

Transfer RNAs or tRNAs bring or tansfer the proper amino acid to the ribosome based on the genetic code. The anticodon at the bottom of the tRNA molecule binds to the codon on the mRNA. The codon on the mRNA is specific for an amino acid or stop codon. Stop codons do not have corresponding tRNA molecules, and signify the end of translation. The amino acid is attached to the 3' end of the tRNA. Only one amino acid can be attached to a tRNA, based on that tRNA's anticodon. Because there are 61 separate codons (actually 64, but three are stop codons) that can bind to anticodons, there must be 61 different tRNAs in a cell. The covalent attachment of an amino acid to the tRNA is catalyzed by enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA syntheses through a process called aminoacylation. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, through aminoacylation, produces aminoacyl-tRNA molecules with an amino acid attached to their 3- ends. There is a single aminoacyl tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. This process is also known as "charging" the tRNA with the amino acid.





Initiation in Prokaryotes


The initiation of translation in prokaryotes involves the assembly of the ribosome and addition of the first amino acid, methionine. The 30S ribosomal subunit attaches to the mRNA. Next, the specific methionine tRNA is brought into the P. The anticodon of this tRNA will bind to the AUG (start) codon on the mRNA. This is the only time a tRNA will be brought into the P site; all successive tRNA’s will be brought to the A site as translation continues. The 50S ribosomal subunit then binds to the 30S subunit, completing the ribosome.





Initiation in Eukaryotes


The initiation of protein translation in eukaryotes is similar to that of prokaryotes with some minor modifications. The 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail are involved in the recruitment of the ribosome. In eukaryotes the ribosome scans along the mRNA for the first start methionine codon. Translation may begin at all AUG codons, however only an in-frame AUG will produce a functional polypeptide. The tRNAs with attached amino acids are delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes), which aid in decoding the mRNA codon sequence.

For an animation of translation, see http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/translation/first.htm .





Elongation


Elongation is fairly similar between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As translation begins, the start tRNA is sitting on the AUG codon in the P site of the ribosome, so the next codon available to accept a tRNA is at the A site. Elongation proceeds after initiation with the binding of an tRNA to the A site. The next tRNA binds to the codon, bringing the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome, and a peptide bond joins between the start methionine and the next amino acid. This reaction is catalyzed by the ribosome. The new polypeptide chain is released from the initial tRNA. The entire ribosome complex moves along the mRNA, sending the first tRNA into the E site and the tRNA with the growing polypeptide into the P site. The A site is now empty and ready to accept another tRNA. The first tRNA now leaves the ribosome. The A site accepts a tRNA with an attached amino acid, a peptide bond forms between the two adjacent amino acids, and the process continues.





Termination


Termination of translation occurs when the ribosome comes to one of the three stop codons, for which there is no tRNA. At this point, a protein called a release factor binds to the A site. The release factor causes the addition of a water molecule to the polypeptide chain, resulting in the release of the completed chain from the tRNA and ribosome. The ribosome, release factor, and tRNAs then dissociate and translation is complete. The process of translation is summarized in Figure below .



Figure 9.28

Summary of translation. Notice the mRNA segment within the ribosome. A tRNA anticodon binds to the appropriate codon, bringing the corresponding amino acid into the ribosome where it can be added to the growing polypeptide chain.





Post-Translational Modification and Protein Folding


The events following protein synthesis often include post-translational modification of the peptide chain and folding of the protein into its functional conformation. During and after synthesis, polypeptide chains often fold into secondary and then tertiary structures. These levels of organization were discussed in the Organic Compounds: Proteins (Advanced) concept. Briefly, the primary structure of the protein is the sequence of amino acids determined by the gene and mRNA. The secondary and tertiary structures are determined by interactions between the amino acids within the polypeptide ( Figure below ).

Many proteins undergo post-translational modification, allowing them to then perform their specific function. This may include the formation of disulfide bridges or attachment of any of a number of biochemical functional groups, such as phosphate groups, carbohydrates or lipids. Certain amino acids may be removed, or the polypeptide chain may be cut into two pieces. Lastly, two or more polypeptides may interact with each other, forming a functional protein with a quaternary structure.

The four stages of protein folding.

What causes albinism?

This rare albino alligator must have the specific "instructions," or DNA, to have this quality. Albinism is inherited in a recessive fashion. The cause of albinism is a mutation in a gene for melanin, a protein found in skin and eyes. Such a mutation may result in no melanin production at all or a significant decline in the amount of melanin.





Mutations


You have learned that an allele is an alternative form of a gene. Most, if not all genes have alternative forms causing the resulting protein to function slightly differently. But are there alleles that cause proteins to function dramatically differently or not function at all? A mutation is a change in the DNA or RNA sequence, and many mutations result in new alleles. Some mutations have no effect on the protein, whereas others are either beneficial or harmful. In fact, evolution could not take place without the genetic variation that results from beneficial mutations. In humans, harmful mutations can result in genetic diseases. There are also chromosomal mutations, large changes with dramatic effects. See Mutations are changes in genetic information at http://www.dnaftb.org/27/animation.html for a description of the early work on mutations.





New Genes


It is believed that large mutations form new genes. Mutations that duplicate large sections of DNA are a major source of genetic material for new genes. It is thought that tens to hundreds of genes are duplicated in animal genomes every million years. Most genes belong to larger families of genes of shared ancestry. These gene families have domains within the protein with a particular and independent function. These domains have corresponding conserved regions within their genes. It is through duplication mutations that such gene families formed. Genetic recombination after duplication of different domains forms new combinations of domains with new functions. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for color vision and one for night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene.





Alu Sequences


DNA sequences that can translocate around the genome comprise a significant fraction of the genetic material of plants and animals. There may be some evolutionary significance to these movable elements. One example is the Alu sequence or Alu element. More than a million copies of the Alu sequence are present in the human genome, making this transposon equivalent to just under 11% of the human genome.

Alu insertions are sometimes disruptive and can result in inherited disorders. The insertion or deletion of Alu sequences are associated with some specific effects in humans, including breast cancer, familial hypercholesterolemia, hemophilia and neurofibromatosis.

Alu elements are about 300 base pairs long and are classified as short interspersed elements (SINEs) among the class of repetitive DNA elements. It is believed modern Alu elements evolved from a head to tail fusion of two distinct antique RNA monomers over 100 million years ago. The monomers are opposing but complementary RNA fragments joined by an A-rich linker. Alu elements are derived from the signal recognition particle RNA. This RNA is the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) ribonucleoprotein complex. This complex is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein that directs the traffic of proteins within the cell and allows them to be secreted. The Alu element probably originated from a 7SL RNA gene after deletion of a central sequence.



Figure 9.30

Human SRP RNA. Alu elements were derived from a similar sequence. Notice all the hairpin loops of repeating complimentary sequence.





New Chromosomes


How do new chromosomes form? Is it possible for two chromosomes to fuse? In short, yes it is. In the hominids that arose after the split from the orangutans, two chromosomes fused to produce what is chromosome 2 in humans. This fusion did not occur in the lineage of the other apes, and they retain these separate chromosomes. This may have occurred to keep two populations from interbreeding, as they would be genetically incompatible, accelerating the divergence of the populations.





Vocabulary


allele : An alternative form or different version of a gene.



Alu sequence : A short segment of DNA originally characterized by the action of the Alu restriction endonuclease; occur in large numbers in primate genomes.



duplication : Refers to a mutation that double genetic sequence information.



hominids : A taxonomic family of primates, including four extant genera: chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan), gorillas (Gorilla), humans (Homo), and orangutans (Pongo); also known as the great apes.



mutation : A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA.



short interspersed elements (SINEs) : Short DNA sequences that represent reverse-transcribed RNA molecules.



signal recognition particle (SRP) : An abundant universally conserved ribonucleoprotein that recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes.

What does radiation contamination do?

It mutates DNA. The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986. It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. A Russian publication concludes that 985,000 excess cancers occurred between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination. The 2011 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk calculates a total of 1.4 million excess cancers occurred as a result of this contamination.





Causes of Mutation


Is it possible for mutations to occur spontaneously, or does there have to be a cause of the mutation? Well, the answer is that both are possible. Mutagenesis is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed in a stable manner, resulting in a mutation. In nature mutagenesis can lead to changes that are beneficial or harmful, or have no effect. Harmful mutations can lead to cancer and various heritable diseases, but beneficial mutations are the driving force of evolution. In 1927, Hermann Muller first demonstrated the effects of mutations with observable changes in chromosomes. He induced mutagenesis by irradiating fruit flies with X-rays,

Mutagenesis may occur spontaneously or be induced. A spontaneous mutation can just happen. These mutations are not caused by an environmental factor, but occur during normal cellular processes. A spontaneous mutation may be due to a mistake during DNA replication or transcription. Mutations may also occur during mitosis and meiosis. A mutation caused by an environmental factor, or mutagen , is known as an induced mutation . Typical mutagens include chemicals, like those inhaled while smoking, and radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet light, and nuclear radiation. Table below lists some spontaneous mutations that are common.

Discuss potential outcomes of point mutations.

Discuss consequences of effect-on-function mutations.





Six fingers?

Obviously this is not very common. But it is not that uncommon, with an incidence of about 1 in 500 live births. Known as polydactyly, this phenotype has been associated with over 35 genetic mutations.





Types of Mutations


Mutations, a change in the DNA or RNA sequence, may have no effect, may be beneficial or may be harmful. There are numerous ways that the genetic information can be changed. Some of these changes can be inherited. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations , which can be passed on to descendants, and somatic mutations , which cannot be transmitted to the next generation. Germline mutations change the DNA sequence within a sperm or egg cell, and therefore can be inherited. This inherited mutation may result in a class of diseases known as a genetic disease. The mutation may lead to a nonfunctional protein, and the embryo may not develop properly or survive. Somatic mutations may affect the proper functioning of the cell with the mutation. During DNA replication, the mutation will be copied. The two daughter cells formed after cell division will both carry the mutation. This may lead to the development of many cells that do not function optimally, resulting a less than optimal phenotype. Various types of mutations can all have severe effects on the individual. These include point mutations, framehift mutations and chromosomal alterations. Keep in mind, some mutations may be beneficial or have no effect. Mutations that have no effect will not affect the expression of the gene or the sequence of amino acids in an encoded protein.





Chromosomal Alterations


Chromosomal alterations are large changes in the chromosome structure. They occur when genetic material is added or removed from a chromosome. This alteration of a chromosome may occur when a section of a chromosome breaks and rejoins a chromosome incorrectly, or does not rejoin at all. Sometimes the segment may join backwards or reattach to another chromosome altogether. These mutations are very serious and usually lethal to the zygote or embryo. If the embryo does survive, the resulting organism is usually sterile and thus, unable to pass along the mutation.

The five types of chromosomal alterations are deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations ( Figure below ).

Deletions are the removal of a large chromosomal region, leading to loss of the genes within that region.

Duplications (or amplifications ) lead to multiple copies of a chromosomal region, increasing the number of the genes located within that region. Some genes may be duplicated in their entirety.

Insertions are the addition of material from one chromosome to a nonhomologous chromosome.

Inversions are reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.

Translocations are the interchange of genetic material between nonhomologous chromosomes.





Figure 9.32

Chromosomal alterations. Deletion: the blue segment has been removed; Duplication: the blue segment has been duplicated; Inversions: the blue segment has been reversed; Insertion: the yellow segment has been removed from chromosome 4 and placed into chromosome 20; Translocation: a green segment from chromosome 4 has been exchanged with a red segment from chromosome 20.





Point Mutations


As the name implies, point mutations occur at a single site within the DNA. The example from Protein Synthesis: The Genetic Code (Advanced) concept demonstrates this mutation:

THE BIG FAT CAT ATE THE RED RAT.

A change at any one position could result in a sequence that does not make sense. Such as the C to A change shown here

THE BIG FAT AAT ATE THE RED RAT.

As shown above, point mutations exchange one nucleotide for another and are known as base substitution mutations. These mutations are often caused either by chemicals or by a mistake during DNA replication. A transition exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T), and is the most common point mutation. Less common is a transversion , which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). Point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene are classified by the effect on the resulting protein:

Type Description Example Effect

Silent mutated codon codes for the same amino acid CAA (glutamine) → CAG (glutamine) none

Missense mutated codon codes for a different amino acid CAA (glutamine) → CCA (proline) variable

Nonsense mutated codon is a premature stop codon CAA (glutamine) → UAA (stop) usually serious

These mutations may result in a protein with the same function, with altered function, or with no function. Silent mutations , as they code for the same amino acid, will have no altered effect on the protein. Missense mutations may have a minor effect or a dramatic effect on the protein. Nonsense mutations usually have the most dramatic effet. Depending on the position of the premature stop codon, nonsense mutations may result in an unstable mRNA that cannot be translated, or in a truncated mRNA and a much "smaller" protein without any significant activity.





Deletions and Insertions


Similar to chromosomal alteration mutations, deletion or insertion mutations add or remove genetic information. Small deletions or insertions in the DNA will alter the reading frame. Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA, whereas insertions add one or more nucleotides into the DNA. These mutations in the coding region of a gene may also alter the splicing of the mRNA, known as a splice site mutation . Mutations which alter the reading frame are known as frameshift mutations . Splice site mutations and frameshift mutations both can dramatically change the mRNA, altering the final protein product.

Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA: AUG-AAU-ACG-GCU which is translated into start-asparagine-threonine-alanine.

Now, assume an insertion occurs in this sequence. Let’s say an A nucleotide is inserted after the start codon AUG :

AUG-AAA-UAC-GGC-U is now translated into start-lysine-tyrosine-glycine.

Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it. As this example shows, a frameshift mutation can dramatically change how the codons in mRNA are read. This can have a drastic effect on the protein product.





Effect-on-Function Mutations


For a cell or organism to maintain homeostasis, the proteins work in a highly defined and regulated manner. It may take just one protein not working correctly to interrupt homeostasis. A protein having more or less activity than normal, or a different activity or function, may be enough to interrupt homeostasis. Mutations that may result in altered function of the gene product or protein are loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations, as well as dominant negative mutations.





Loss-of-Function


Loss-of-function mutations result in a gene product or protein having less or no function. These mutations are usually recessive as a dominant normal gene can overcome the effects of the mutation. A null allele has a complete loss of function. This will result in reduced dosage (amount) of a normal gene product in heterozygous individuals. This reduced dosage may result in a normal phenotype. Haploinsufficiency results in when a reduced dosage of a normal gene product does not produce a normal phenotype. An example of a null allele is the O allele in the human A, B and O blood type system. A and B refer to antigens on the surface of red blood cells. The alleles for the A-antigen and B-antigen are co-dominant; if both are present, then both are expressed resulting in type AB blood. The O blood type allele is a single base change mutated version of the A-antigen allele, resulting in no antigen expressed. As no protein product is produced, the allele for the O blood type is a null allele.





Gain-of-Function


Gain-of-function mutations result in the gene product or protein having a new and abnormal function and usually result in a dominant phenotype. Examples of gain of function mutations occur in the thyroid hormone receptor gene.

The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are necessary for maintaining an appropriate basal metabolic rate and affect essentially every tissue in the body. They are produced by the thyroid gland. Production of these hormones is stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), a glycoprotein secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. TSH binds with the TSH receptor on the surface of the cells of the thyroid gland, initiating a series of biochemical events that result in an increase in circulating thyroid hormones, which have numerous effects. T3 and T4 levels are maintained by a negative feedback loop mechanism. Mutations within the gene coding for the TSH receptor can result in problems for the body in controlling thyroid hormone levels. Gain-of-functions mutations in the gene for the TSH receptor result in the receptor being constitutively active, or "switched on," even in the absence of TSH. These mutations result in more thyroid hormone produced, resulting in the inability to maintain homeostasis and detrimental phenotypes. A number of loss-of-function mutations have also been identified in the TSH receptor gene.





Dominant Negative


Dominant negative mutations have an altered gene product that acts in a dominant manner to the wild-type gene product in the same cell. These two gene products often dimerize (combine) to make the protein. Often the effects of such a mutation result in an inactive gene product. Dominant negative mutations are often more harmful than null alleles. Examples of dominant negative mutations occur with the collagen genes.

Type II collagen is the preeminent protein in cartilage. The protein forms from three gene products of the gene for type II collagen, COL2A1 . Mutations in the COL2A1 gene result in a phenotypic spectrum of disease, ranging from primatial lethal to comparatively moderate phenotypes. The collagen protein is a trimer of three polypeptides. A COL2A1 null allele will result in decreased amounts of normal collagen polypeptides produced. Decreased amounts of the collagen protein result in a mild phenotype compared to phenotypes that result from a dominant negative mutation. Half normal and half mutant polypeptides produced combine to form almost all abnormal collagen protein product. As the cartilage with this abnormal protein is the precursor to bone formation, this process is hindered, and these children have severe phenotypes. Some mutations lead to death in utero . Similar dominant negative mutations are characteristic of the type I collagen disorders and the Osteogenesis Imperfecta phenotypes, which are also known as Brittle-Bone sides.

DNA Repair - Advanced


Define and discuss the importance of DNA repair.

Describe common DNA repair mechanism.





How is DNA repaired?

Not by nanobots. But luckily the cell does have mechanisms to repair mistakes in the DNA. And these mechanisms involve proteins.





DNA Repair


DNA repair refers to a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to DNA. Many mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA. One way DNA can be repaired, called nucleotide excision repair is illustrated in Figure below . If a cell’s DNA is permanently damaged and cannot be repaired, the cell is likely to be prevented from dividing. See Some types of mutations are automatically repaired at http://www.dnaftb.org/28/animation.html for an animation on mutation repair.



Figure 9.33

When DNA is damaged by sunlight, the damage is recognized differently depending on whether the DNA is transcriptionally active (transcription-coupled repair) or not (global excision repair). After the initial recognition step, the damage is repaired in a similar manner with the final outcome being the restoration of the normal nucleotide sequence.



One form of DNA repair corrects mistakes made during DNA replication or recombination. DNA mismatch repair is a system for recognizing and repairing erroneous insertion, deletion and mis-incorporation of bases that can arise during these processes. Mismatch repair is a highly conserved process from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The Mut proteins are the major active components of this repair system. MutS, MutH and MutL are three proteins essential in detecting the mismatch and directing repair machinery to it. These three proteins recognize the mismatch and cause the DNA to loop out. MutH cuts the DNA strand near the closest methylated site to the mismatch, and a helices separates the DNA strands. The entire MutSHL complex then slides along the DNA in the direction of the mismatch, followed by an exonuclease that digests the single-stranded DNA. The single-stranded gap created by the exonuclease is then be repaired by DNA Polymerase III.





Nucleotide Excision Repair


Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes the vast majority of UV-induced DNA damage, mostly in the form of thymine dimers. Genetic diseases that result from mutations in the NER genes include Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome. NER enzymes recognize changes in the shape of the DNA double helix. Recognition of these changes leads to the removal of the damage, creating a single-strand gap in the DNA. This gap is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged strand as a template. In E. coli , this process is controlled by the UvrABC endonuclease enzyme complex, which consists of four Uvr proteins: UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, and DNA helicase II (or UvrD). In eukaryotes, this process is more complicated, controlled by nine major proteins.

See What Is Xeroderma Pigmentosum? at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDtZyUc1gB8 for additional information on this disease.



Click on the image above for more content

Two forms of NER exist within the cell. Global genomic NER (or global excision repair) repairs damage in both transcribed and untranscribed DNA strands in active and inactive genes throughout the genome. This process utilizes damage sensing proteins that constantly scan the DNA for distortions in the helix. Repair proteins then verify and repair the damage. This process is ongoing as at any one time, most of the DNA is not undergoing transcription. Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) is a faster process than global genomic NER. In TC-NER, RNA polymerase serves as the damage recognition signal when it stalls at a change in the shape of the DNA double helix. This allows repair to proceed much quicker then with global repair mechanisms.





Base Excision Repair


Base excision repair repairs small, non-helix distorting changes in the DNA, usually resulting from damage during the cell cycle. The process begins with enzymes known as DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. AP sites are apurinic or apyrimidinic sites (or a basic sites), which are locations in DNA that have neither a purine nor a pyrimidine base. The gap is then recognized by an AP endonuclease, which nicks the sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA polymerase and DNA ligase then fill in and close the gap. See DNA repair: Base excision repair at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4khROaOO6c for additional information.

Significance of Mutations - Advanced


Discuss the significance of germline and somatic mutations.

Explain why some mutations are harmful and some beneficial.

Discuss the relationship between mutations and evolution.





Is this rat hairless?

Yes. Why? The result of a mutation, a change in the DNA sequence. The effects of mutations can vary widely, from being beneficial, to having no effect, to having lethal consequences, and every possibility in between.





Significance of Mutation


Are all mutations bad? No. Obviously large chromosomal changes are going to have a significant effect. But what about single base changes? Many single base mutations most likely have no effect, unless they change the reading frame. The effects of any one mutations can vary from having no effect to having lethal consequences.

Imagine the coding sequence (broken up into codons) TAC CCC GGG. This is a fairly generic coding sequence, and probably occurs many times in the human genome. It transcribes into the following mRNA: AUG GGG CCC, which would translate into start-glycine-proline. As glycine is encoded by four codons (GGG, GGA, GGC, GGU), any change in the third position of that codon will have no effect. The same is true for the codon for proline. If a mutation does not change the amino acid sequence in a protein, the mutation will have no effect. In fact, the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect, since DNA repair mechanisms are able to mend most of the changes before they become permanent. Furthermore, many organisms have mechanisms for eliminating otherwise permanently mutated somatic cells.

But what about changes in the other nucleotides in the sequence? They could have potentially dramatic effects. The effects depend on the outcome of the mutation. Obviously any change to the start codon will interrupt the start of translation. Turning the simple glycine into the nonpolar (and relatively large) tryptophan (UGG codon) could have dramatic effects on the function of the protein. And any change to a stop codon will extend translation until the next in-frame stop codon.

Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.





Mutations and Evolution


A gene pool is the complete set of unique alleles in a species or population. Mutations create variation in the gene pool. Populations with a large gene pool are said to be genetically diverse and very robust. They are able to survive intense times of natural selection against certain phenotypes. During these times of selection, individuals with less favorable phenotypes resulting from deleterious alleles (due to mutations) may be selected against and removed from the population. Concurrently, the more favorable mutations that cause beneficial or advantageous phenotypes tend to accumulate in that population, resulting, over time, in evolution. In fact, without any change in the gene pool, without any new alleles added due to new mutations, evolution could not occur. Genetic change is the driving force of evolution. In fact, evolution can be genetically defined as the change allele frequencies over time.

Mutations are the key to species evolving. Lets say an organism "mutates" due to a new allele for a gene that determines coat color. There are, theoretically, only three outcomes of that mutation:

The "new" coat color does not allow the organism to camouflage itself. The organism dies and the new allele dies with it.

The mutation has no significant effect on organism. The organism lives as before, passing the allele to its offspring.

The mutation is beneficial to the organism. The organism can hunt and survive more efficiently than before. Individuals with this beneficial allele live longer and reproduce more; they are more "fit" to survive in their environment. This is the basis of Darwin's "survival of the fittest" philosophy. Soon more individuals within the population have the beneficial allele.





Beneficial Mutations


Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, and a significant health concern all over the world. Except for a small community in Italy.

All humans have a gene for a protein called Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), which is part of the system that transports cholesterol through the bloodstream. Apo-A1 is an high density lipoprotein (HDL). HDLs are known as "good" cholesterol as they remove cholesterol from artery walls. A small community in Italy is known to have a mutant version of this protein, named Apolipoprotein A1-Milano (or Apo A1M). This protein is even more effective at removing cholesterol from cells and dissolving arterial plaques associated with heart disease. It also acts as an antioxidant, preventing arterial damage from inflammation that normally occurs in arteriosclerosis . People with the Apo-A1M gene have significantly lower levels of risk than the general population for heart disease.

Antioxidants are important for the health of a cell. An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons or hydrogen from a substance to an oxidizing agent, producing free radicals in the process. These free radicals initiate a chain reaction in the cell that can cause cell damage, or can lead to cell death. Antioxidants prevent these chain reactions from even initiating.

Beneficial mutations are also found in many bacteria that allow them to survive in the presence of antibiotic drugs. The mutations lead to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, producing strains that have adapted to their environment. By definition, that is evolution.





Harmful Mutations


Mutations can result in errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. These can obviously result in harm to the cell and organism. To function correctly and maintain homeostasis , each cell depends on thousands of proteins to all work together to perform the functions of the cell. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the cell, the cell, tissue, organ, or organ system may not function properly, resulting in a medical condition. A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder or genetic disease. However, only a small percentage of mutations cause genetic disorders; most have no impact on health. If a mutation does not change the protein sequence or structure, resulting in the same function, it will have no effect on the cell. Often, these mutations are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair mistakes in DNA ( Figure below ). Because DNA can be damaged or mutated in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the cell protects itself to maintain proper function.



Figure 9.34

DNA repair. Shown is a model of DNA ligase repairing chromosomal damage. DNA ligase is an enzyme that joins broken nucleotides together by catalyzing the formation of a bond between the phosphate group and deoxyribose sugar of adjacent nucleotides in the DNA backbone.

Mutations and Cancer - Advanced


Discuss the relationship between mutations and cancer.

Explain the role of oncogenes and tuner suppressor genes in carcinogenesis.





What makes a cell cancerous?

Luckily, it is not an easy process. A number of things have to go wrong. Many times, mutations in the DNA are involved. And not just one mutation, but more than one is needed.





Mutations and Cancer


In the Cell Cycle: Cancer (Advanced) concept, cancer is described as developing due to unregulated cell division. That is, cancer is a disease characterized by a population of cells that grow and divide without respect to normal limits. These cancerous cells invade and destroy adjacent tissues, and they may spread throughout the body. The process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells is known as carcinogenesis . This process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis. Oncogenes are mutated genes involved in the development of cancer.

Nearly all cancers are caused by mutations in the DNA of the abnormal cells. These mutations may be due to the effects of carcinogens , cancer causing agents such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or infectious agents. These carcinogens may act as an environmental “trigger,” stimulating the onset of cancer in certain individuals and not others. Do all people who smoke get cancer? No. Can secondhand smoke increase a nonsmoking person's chance of developing lung cancer? Yes. It also increases a nonsmoking person's chance of developing heart disease.

Complex interactions between carcinogens and an individual’s genome may explain why only some people develop cancer after exposure to an environmental trigger and others do not. Do all cancers need an environmental trigger to develop? No. Cancer causing mutations may also result from errors incorporated into the DNA during replication, or they may be inherited. Inherited mutations are present in all cells of the organism.





Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes


Mutations found in the DNA of cancer cells typically affect two general classes of genes: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In “normal,” non-cancerous cells, the products of proto-oncogenes promote cell growth and mitosis prior to cell division; thus, proto-oncogenes encode proteins needed for normal cellular functions. Mutations in proto-oncogenes can modify their expression and the function of the gene product, increasing the amount of activity of the product protein. When this happens, they become oncogenes; thus, the cells have a higher chance of dividing excessively and uncontrollably. Cancer-promoting oncogenes are often activated in cancer cells, giving those cells abnormal properties. The products of these genes result in uncontrolled cell growth and division, protection against programmed cell death, loss of respect for normal tissue boundaries, and the ability to become established in diverse tissue environments. Proto-oncogenes cannot be removed from the genome, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis. It is only when they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.

In “normal” cells, the products of tumor suppressor genes temporarily discourage cell growth and division to allow cells to finish routine functions, especially DNA repair. Tumor suppressors are generally transcription factors , activated by cellular stress or DNA damage. The function of such genes is to stop the cell cycle in order to carry out DNA repair, preventing mutations from being passed on to daughter cells. However, if the tumor suppressor genes are inactivated, DNA repair cannot occur. Tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated by a mutation that either affects the gene directly or that affects the pathway that activates the gene. The consequence of the lack of DNA repair is that DNA damage accumulates, is not repaired, and inevitably leads to detrimental phenotypes, such as cancer.





Oncogenes


Categories of oncogenes are described in the table below. Oncogenes may be growth factors, protein kinases, GTPases or transcription factors. Growth factors are naturally occurring substances, usually a protein or steroid hormone, capable of stimulating cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation. They are important for regulating a variety of cellular processes. Usually they must bind to an extracellular or intracellular receptor to initiate a cellular reaction. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a protein in a cell. They function as a control switch in many cellular functions, turning a function on or off, and regulating other cellular processes. Many times they are involved in activating a cascade of reactions. Tyrosine kinases may be either membrane bound receptors, with an intracellular kinase domain, or they may be cytoplasmic kinases. As their names imply, tyrosine kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues and serene/threonine kinases phosphorylate serene or threonine residues. Transcription factors are DNA binding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription, and GTPases are a large family of enzymes that can bind and hydrolyze GTP (guanosine triphosphate) to GDP. All these processes are related in that they involve phosphate groups and phosphorylation activities. The phosphorylation of a target protein usually is an initial step in a cascade of intracellular processes, and is normally activated under specific conditions. If these processes are constitutively active, then homeostasis will be disrupted and detrimental phenotypes may result. More on protein kinases can be seen at http://wn.com/protein_kinase .

Category Examples Description

Growth factors, or mitogens c-Sis Usually secreted by specialized cells to induce cell proliferation in the cell, nearby cells, or distant cells. An oncogene may cause a cell to secrete growth factors that would normally not be secreted. The oncogene will thereby induce its own uncontrolled proliferation, as well as the proliferation of neighboring cells. It may also cause production of growth hormones in other parts of the body.

Receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), HER2/neu Receptor tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to other proteins to activate or inactivate them. Receptor kinases add phosphate groups to receptor proteins at the surface of the cell. These receptor proteins receive signals from outside the cell and initiate a signal transduction process inside the cell. Tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to tyrosine residues in the target protein. They can cause cancer by turning the receptor permanently on (constitutively), even without signals from outside the cell.

Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases Src-family, Syk-ZAP-70 family, and BTK family of tyrosine kinases, the Abl gene in CML - Philadelphia chromosome Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are similar to receptor tyrosine kinases, except that they are located within the cell. They in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues of target proteins, initiating a cascade of intracellular processes.

Cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases and their regulatory subunits Raf kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinases. Cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases are similar to cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, except that serene or throne residues are phosphorylated.

Regulatory GTPases Ras protein Ras is a small GTPase that hydrolyses GTP into GDP and phosphate. Ras is activated by growth factor signaling, and activates or inactivates growth signaling pathways. Downstream effectors of Ras include Raf, MEK, MEKK, MAPK, ERK, most of which in turn regulate genes that mediate cell proliferation.

Transcription factors myc, fos myc gene products regulate transcription of genes that induce cell proliferation. c-fos gene products interacts with c-jun and forms the AP-1 early response transcription factor.





Several Mutations to Cause Cancer


Typically, a series of several mutations that constitutively activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes is required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell ( Figure below ). Cells have developed a number of control mechanisms to overcome mutations in proto-oncogenes. Therefore, a cell needs multiple mutations to transform into a cancerous cell. A mutation in one proto-oncogene would not cause cancer, as the effects of the mutation would be masked by the normal control of the cell cycle and the actions of tumor suppressor genes. Similarly, a mutation in one tumor suppressor gene would not cause cancer either, due to the presence of many "backup" genes that duplicate its functions. It is only when enough proto-oncogenes have mutated into oncogenes and enough tumor suppressor genes have been deactivated that the cancerous transformation can begin. Signals for cell growth overwhelm the signals for growth regulation, and the cell quickly spirals out of control. Often, because many of these genes regulate the processes that prevent most damage to the genes themselves, DNA damage accumulates as one ages.

Usually, oncogenes are dominant alleles, as they contain gain-of-function mutations . The actions of the mutant allele gene product, many times resulting in a constitutively activated protein, are dominant to the gene product produced by the "normal" allele. Meanwhile, mutated tumor suppressors are generally recessive alleles, as they contain loss-of-function mutations . A proto-oncogene needs only a mutation in one copy of the gene to generate an oncogene; a tumor suppressor gene needs a mutation in both copies of the gene to render both products defective. There are instances when, however, one mutated allele of a tumor suppressor gene can render the other copy non-functional. These instances result in what is known as a dominant negative effect .



Figure 9.35

Cancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell. In this example, the first mutation inactivates a tumor suppressor gene, the second mutation inactivates a DNA repair gene, the third mutation creates an oncogene, and a fourth mutation inactivates several more tumor suppressor genes, resulting in cancer. It should be noted that it does not necessarily require four or more mutations to lead to cancer.

Regulation of Gene Expression - Advanced


Explain the importance of the regulation of gene expression.

Describe general mechanisms of gene expression.





Can your expression change at any moment?

As you know, a person's expression can change moment by moment. The expression that is demonstrated is usually appropriate for that moment's feelings. Gene expression is the use of a gene whose product is necessary for that moment. It may be a moment during development, it may be a moment of increased anxiety, or it may be in response to an environmental change. Whenever a particular protein is needed, gene expression provides it.





Regulation of Gene Expression


Each of your cells has about 22,000 genes. In fact, all of your cells have the same genes. So do all of your cells make the same proteins? Do all 22,000 genes get turned into proteins in every cell? Of course not. If they did, then all your cells would do the same thing. And it would be a devastating waste of energy.

You have cells with different functions because you have cells with different proteins. And your cells have different proteins because they “use” different genes. The regulation of gene expression , or gene regulation , includes the mechanism to turn genes “on” and transcribe those gene into RNA. Any aspect of a gene's expression may be regulated, from the onset of transcription to the post-translational modification of a protein.

In general terms, gene regulation may occur in the following stages of gene expression:

transcription,

post-transcriptional modification,

RNA transport,

translation,

mRNA degradation, and/or

post-translational modifications.



It is this regulation that determines when and how much of a protein to make, giving a cell its specific structure and function. The process of gene expression is used by all living organisms, from the simplest prokaryote to the most complex eukaryote. And each cell in these organisms regulates gene expression to produce only the necessary proteins.

An overview of gene regulation is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtNZwd3brg (7:03).



Click on the image above for more content

Gene regulation gives the cell control over its structure and function. Thus, gene regulation is the basis for cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Though gene regulation occurs at the cellular level, it controls the versatility and adaptability of any organism, from single celled organisms to organisms made of trillions of cells. Gene regulation also has a role in natural selection and evolution, as the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a significant effect on the functions of the gene product, which can have a profound effect on the functions of a cell, tissue, organ, organ system or even organism. Gene regulation of the bacterial lac operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be identified and described. François Jacob and Jacques Monod (together with André Lwoff) were awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work (see http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1965/jacob.html ).





Vocabulary


gene expression : The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.



gene regulation : The process that activates the expression of a specific gene.



lac operon : An operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in E. coli.



operon : A region of prokaryotic DNA with a promoter, an operator, and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task.





Summary


The regulation of gene expression determines which genes are expressed and when those genes are expressed.

This regulatory process is instrumental in determining the structure and function of a cell.

Define a transcription factor.

Describe common cis-regulatory elements.





What turns a gene on?

Many times it involves a protein binding to DNA. Shown here is a model of p53 protein bound to DNA. p53 is a transcription factor whose inactivation can trigger the onset of cancer.





Mechanisms of Gene Regulation


Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the initiation of transcription to the post-translational modification of a protein. Following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated:

Chemical and structural modification of DNA or chromatin.

Transcription.

Translation.

Post-transcriptional modification.

RNA transport.

mRNA degradation.

Post-translational modifications.



In this concept, we will focus on regulation at the level of transcription. During transcription, RNA polymerase binds to a gene and reads the DNA template to make a complementary strand of RNA. How does RNA polymerase know which genes to bind to, when to bind to those genes, and where on the gene to bind? Concerning the binding of RNA polymerase, the which, when and where is a highly regulated process. When RNA polymerase binds to a gene, it binds to the promoter , a segment of DNA that allows a gene to be transcribed. The promoter helps RNA polymerase find the start of a gene.





cis and trans


Gene regulation at the level of transcription controls when transcription occurs as well as how much RNA is created. This regulation is controlled by cis-regulatory elements ( cis from the Latin word meaning "on the same side as") and trans-acting factors ( trans from the Latin root meaning "across from"). A cis-regulatory element is a region of DNA which regulates the expression of a gene or multiple genes located on that same strand of DNA. These cis-regulatory elements are often the binding sites of one or more trans-acting factors, usually a regulatory protein which interacts with RNA polymerase. A cis-regulatory element may be located in a gene’s promoter region, in an intron, or in the 3' region. A regulatory protein , or a transcription factor , is a protein involved in regulating gene expression. It is usually bound to a cis-regulatory element. Regulatory proteins often must be bound to a cis-regulatory element to switch a gene on (activator), or to turn a gene off (repressor). Common cis-regulatory elements include the TATA box, Pribnow box and CCAAT box. More about transcription factors will be discussed in the Regulation of Gene Expression: Transcription Factors (Advanced) concept.





The TATA Box


The TATA box is a cis-regulatory element found in the promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes. It is a highly conserved sequence, believed to have remained consistent throughout much of the evolution. Approximately 24% of human genes contain a TATA box within the core promoter. The TATA box has the core DNA sequence 5'-TATAAA-3' or a slight variant. It is usually located 25 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. During transcription, the TATA binding protein binds to the TATA box. This protein helps unwind the DNA double helix, allowing RNA polymerase II to bind and begin transcription.

However, prior to RNA polymerase binding to the promoter, the TATA binding protein interacts with other factors to form TFIID, a general transcription factor that is part of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. TFIIA binds to the upstream part of TFIID while TFIIB binds to the downstream part of TFIID. Now RNA polymerase recognizes this multi-protein complex and binds to it, along with various other transcription factors, initiating transcription. RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand, leaving TFIID and TFIIA bound to the TATA box where they can then facilitate the binding of additional RNA polymerase II molecules.

The complex of RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors is known as a basal transcriptional complex (BTC) . The BTC only provides a low level of transcription. Other cis and trans factors must stimulate the BTC to increase transcription levels. One such example of a BTC stimulating region of DNA is the CAAT box.





The Pribnow Box


The Pribnow box is the sequence of six nucleotides that is an essential part of a promoter site in bacteria. The sequence 5'-TATAAT-3' is the most common, though slight variants of that sequence serve the same function. It is located roughly 10 base pairs upstream from transcription initiation site. The Pribnow box has a function similar to the TATA box that occurs in promoters in eukaryotes and archaea. The regulation of transcription in prokaryotic is much simpler than in eukaryotes, and many fewer transcription factors, if any, are necessary. In bacteria, this site is recognized and bound by a subunit of RNA polymerase during initiation of transcription.

The Pribnow box, like the TATA box, is the initial site where hydrogen bonds between the DNA strands are separated. The AT-rich character of the two boxes allows this separation, as adenine and thymine are easier to separate then cytosine-guanine base pairs.





The CCAAT Box


The CCAAT Box , which is also known as the CAAT box or CAT box, is an eukaryotic cis-regulatory element with a 5'-GGCCAATCT-3' consensus sequence. It occurs roughly 75-80 bases upstream of the initial transcription site. This site is known to bind general transcription factors, including the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs). The C/EBPs recruit additional transcription factors to the initiation complex. C/EBPs are characterized by a highly conserved basic- leucine zipper domain. This domain is involved in dimerization and DNA binding like other transcription factors of the leucine zipper domain-containing family, including c-Fos and Jun. Other DNA binding domains include the helix-turn-helix domain, the zinc finger domain and the helix-loop helix domain. These domains are further discussed in the Regulation of Gene Expression: Transcription Factors (Advanced) concept.





Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation


Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by at least five mechanisms:

Specificity factors are proteins that alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to the promoter and begin transcription.

Repressors are proteins that bind to non-coding sequences on the DNA that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand.

Basal factors are transcription factors that help position RNA polymerase at the start of a gene.

Enhancers are sites on the DNA strand that are bound by activators in order to loop the DNA, bringing a specific promoter to the initiation complex. An initiation complex is composed of RNA polymerase and numerous trans-acting factors.

Activators are proteins that enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter.



As the organism grows more sophisticated, gene regulation becomes more complex, though prokaryotic organisms possess some highly regulated systems. Some human genes are controlled by many activators and repressors working together. Obviously, a mutation in a cis-regulatory region, such as the promoter, can greatly affect the proper expression of a gene. It may keep the gene permanently off, such that no protein can be made, or it can keep the gene permanently on, such that the corresponding protein is constantly made. Both of these can have detremental effects on the cell.

Describe how the lac operon regulates transcription.

Describe regulation of the trp operon.





On or off?

When it comes to genes, that is an important question. And if you're a single-celled organism like a bacterium, conserving energy by not producing unnecessary proteins is very important. So if a protein is not needed, that bacterium wants to keep those genes off.





Prokaryotic Gene Regulation


In prokaryotes, a combination of activators and repressors determines whether a gene is transcribed. As you know, prokaryotic organisms are fairly simple organisms with much less DNA. Prokaryotic genes are arranged in operons , a region of DNA with a promoter, an operator , and one or more genes that encode proteins needed to perform a certain task. To maintain homeostasis (and survive), the organism must quickly adapt changing environmental conditions. The regulation of transcription plays a key role in this process.

For a bacteria, many aspects of gene regulation are due to the presence or absence of certain nutrients. In prokaryotes, repressors bind to regions called operators that are generally located immediately downstream from the promoter. Activators bind to the upstream portion of the promoter.





The Lac Operon


The lac operon ( Figure below ) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in E. coli . The lac operon is regulated by the availability of lactose. The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, three adjacent structural genes which code for enzymes and a terminator. The three genes are: lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The Z gene encodes β-galactosidase, the Y gene encodes permease, and the A gene encodes transacetylase. All three genes are controlled by the same regulatory elements. See Genes can be turned on and off at http://www.dnaftb.org/33/animation.html for a detailed animation of the lac operon.



Figure 9.37

The lac operon. The lac operon contains genes for three enzymes, lac, lacY, and lac A, as well as the promoter, operator, and terminatory regulatory regions.



In bacteria, the lac repressor protein blocks the synthesis of enzymes that digest lactose when there is no lactose present. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to detach from the DNA strand. This mechanism is known as induction and is illustrated in ( Figure below ).

Specific control of the lac operon depends on the availability of lactose. The enzymes needed to metabolize lactose are not produced when lactose is not present. When lactose is available, and therefore needs to be metabolized, the operon is turned on, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, and the three genes are transcribed into a single mRNA molecule. However, if lactose is not present (and therefore does not need to be metabolized), the operon is turned off by the lac repressor protein.

The lacI gene, which encodes the lac repressor, lies near the lac operon and is constitutively expressed. Therefore, the lac repressor protein is always present in the bacteria. In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor protein will bind to the operator, just past the promoter in the lac operon. The repressor blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, keeping the operon turned off. Under this condition, no mRNA is produced from the operon.

When lactose is available, a lactose metabolite called allolactose binds to the allosteric site on the repressor.. This interaction causes a conformational change in the repressor shape and the repressor falls off the operator, allowing RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. Allolactose is called an inducer because it turns on, or induces the expression of the lac genes.



Figure 9.38

Regulation of the lac operon. When lactose is present, RNA polymerase (red) binds to the promoter (P) and the three genes are expressed, producing a single mRNA for the three genes. When lactose is unavailable, the lac repressor (yellow) binds to the operator (O) and inhibits the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. The three genes are not expressed. For an animation of the Lac Operon, see http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/lacOperon/first.htm .





The Trp Operon


The trp operon , shown in ( Figure below ) is an operon that codes for the components for production of the amino acid tryptophan. This operon is regulated so that it is not utilized in the presence of tryptophan. This is an example of negative regulation of gene expression, with tryptophan inhibiting this operon.

This operon contains five structural genes: trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA, which encode tryptophan synthetase, an enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. The operon also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator sequence, as well as a constitutively expressed repressor gene (trpR) located upstream from the structural genes and their promoter. The repressor gene synthesizes a repressor protein that can bind to the operator sequence.

In the absence of tryptophan, the trp operon is active. In the presence of tryptophan, the operon is inactive. When tryptophan is present, the repressor protein and tryptophan bind together, causing a conformational change in the repressor, allowing it to bind to the operator. When the repressor protein is bound to the operator, transcription of the trp genes is blocked. In the lac operon, allolactose binds to the repressor protein preventing binding to the operator and allowing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein making it bind to the operator, effectively blocking gene transcription. In both situations, repression is that of RNA polymerase transcribing the genes in the operon. The trp operon contains a 140bp leader sequence (trpL) and an attenuator sequence between the leader and the first structural gene (trp E), which allows for graded regulation. Attenuation is an additional mechanism of negative feedback in the trp operon.



Figure 9.39

Structure of the trp operon. The trp operon is composed of 5 structural genes, 1 regulatory gene and other regulatory sequences, including the promoter, operator and leader sequence. Within the leader sequence is the attenuator region. In the presence of tryptophan, the structural genes are not transcribed.





Attenuation


Attenuation is an additional mechanism to decrease transcription of the trp operon. Attenuation is possible because the genetic material of prokaryotes in in the cell's cytoplasm with its ribosomes. In prokaryotes, it is possible for ribosomes to begin translating the mRNA while RNA polymerase is still transcribing the DNA sequence, allowing translation to have an effect on transcription.

The 140bp trpL leader sequence is a section of the operon between the operator and the structural genes. This sequence is divided into four short segments designated 1-4, as illustrated in ( Figure below ) . Sequence 1 is partially complementary to sequence 2, which is partially complementary to sequence 3, which is partially complementary to sequence 4, allowing the sequence to form three distinct hairpin structures identified as 1-2, 2-3 or 3-4. The hybridization of strands 1 and 2 to form the 1-2 structure prevents the formation of the 2-3 structure, while the formation of the 2-3 hairpin prevents the formation of the 3-4 structure. The 3-4 hairpin acts as a transcription termination sequence; once the 3-4 structure forms, RNA polymerase will disassociate from the DNA and transcription of the structural genes of the operon will not occur.

A segment of the trpL sequence codes for the leader peptide , a short polypeptide of 14 amino acids. This segment contains two adjacent tryptophan residues, which is a very rare occurrence. If the ribosome attempts to translate this leader peptide while tryptophan levels are low, translation will stall at either of the trp codons. During this time, the ribosome physically blocks segment 1 of the leader sequence, preventing it from forming the 1-2 secondary structure. Sequence 2 now forms the 2-3 structure with sequence 3, which keeps sequence 3 from forming the 3-4 structure. This 2-3 structure is called the anti-termination hairpin as it allows RNA polymerase to continue transcribing the entire operon without interference of the ribosome.

If tryptophan levels are high, the leader peptide is translated fully and the ribosome continues through to the stop codon. The ribosome physically sits on segments 1 and 2 of the leader sequence, allowing the 3-4 hairpin structure to form, which terminates transcription as RNA polymerase falls off the DNA. The operon is only transcribed when tryptophan is unavailable for the ribosome.



Figure 9.40

The transcriptional attenuation of the trp operon involves the formation of mRNA stem-loops from the trpL leader region. In the presence of tryptophan the 3-4 hairpin structure acts as a termination structure, while with low levels of tryptophan the 2-3 hairpin structure allows transcription to continue. A similar attenuation mechanism regulates the synthesis of histidine, phenylalanine, and threonine.

On or Off? On or Off? On or Off?

That is the key question. Why are some genes expressed and others are not? Why do different cell types have different proteins? How do different cell types have different functions? The answers to those questions are related. Gene regulation in eukaryotes is a highly regulated process usually involving many proteins, which either bind to each other or bind to the DNA.





Eukaryotic Gene Regulation


All your cells have the same DNA and therefore the same genes, yet they have different proteins because they express different genes. In eukaryotic cells, the start of transcription is one of the most complex aspects of gene regulation. Transcriptional regulation involves the formation of an initiation complex involving interactions between a number of transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements, and enhancers , distant regions of DNA that can loop back to interact with a gene’s promoter. These regulatory elements occur in unique combinations within a given cell type, resulting in only necessary genes being transcribed in certain cells. Transcription factors , or trans-acting factors, bind to a DNA strand, usually interacting with cis-regulatory elements, allowing RNA polymerase to bind and start transcription.

Each gene has unique cis-regulatory sequences, only allowing specific transcription factors to bind. However, there are common regulatory sequences found in most genes. The TATA box is a cis-regulatory element found in the promoter of most eukaryotic genes. It has the DNA sequence 5'-TATAAA-3' or a slight variant, and has been highly conserved throughout evolution. When the appropriate cellular signals are present, RNA polymerase binds to the TATA box, completing the initiation complex. A number of transcription factors first bind to the TATA box while other transcription factors bind to the previously attached factors, forming a multi-protein complex. It is only when all the appropriate factors are bound that RNA polymerase will recognize the complex and bind to the DNA, initiating transcription. For more on the TATA box in the initiation of transcription, see the TATA Binding sequence animation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EkSBBDQmpE .

One of the more complex eukaryotic gene regulation processes is during development. What genes must be turned on and when during development must that genes be expressed so that tissues and organs form from simple cells?





Regulation of Gene Expression During Development


What makes the heart form during development? What makes the skin form? What makes a structure become an arm instead of a leg? These processes occur during development because of a highly specific pattern of gene expression. This intensely regulated pattern of gene expression turns genes on in the right cell at the right time, such that the resulting proteins can perform their necessary functions to ensure proper development. Transcription factors play an extremely important role during development. Many of these proteins can be considered master regulatory proteins , in the sense that they either activate or deactivate the transcription of other genes and, in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade. Homeobox genes and gap genes are important classes of transcription factors utilized during development.



Figure 9.41

Effect of Hox Gene Mutation. Scientists caused a mutation in a hox gene of this fruit fly. As a result of the mutation, a leg grew out of its head where an antenna should have developed (fly on right). Normal fly (fly on right).





Homeobox Genes


Homeobox genes contain a highly conserved DNA sequence known as a homeobox and are involved in the regulation of genes important to development. A homeobox is a 180 base pairs long highly conserved segment of DNA; it encodes a 60 amino acid domain within the protein known as the homeodomain , which can bind DNA through a helix-turn-helix motif. Proteins with a homeodomain are therefore transcription factors. These factors typically switch on series of other genes, for instance, the genes needed to encode the proteins to make a leg.

The homeobox genes were first found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in the lab of Walter Gehring at the University of Basel, Switzerland, and then in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis in the group of Eddy De Robertis at the same institution. Homeobox genes have subsequently been identified in many other species, from insects to reptiles and mammals including humans. Homeobox genes have even been found in fungi, for example the unicellular yeasts, and in plants.

A particular subgroup of homeobox genes are the Hox genes . Protein products of Hox genes function in patterning the body, providing the placement of certain body parts during development. In other words, Hox genes determine where limbs and other body segments will grow in a developing fetus or larva. Mutations in any one of these genes can lead to the growth of extra, typically non-functional body parts in invertebrates. The Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila results in a leg growing from the head in place of an antenna. A mutation in a vertebrate Hox genes usually results in miscarriage.

Mutations in homeobox genes can produce easily visible phenotypic changes. An example of a homeobox mutation in Drosophila is known as antennapedia , which results in a fly with legs where the antennae should be. Another homeobox mutation results in a fly with a second pair of wings. Furthermore, the duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, further demonstrating the importance of these genes.





Gap Genes


A gap gene controls the shape of a developing zygote early in its development. Many of these genes were first identified in Drosophila based on the discovery of mutant embryos and flies. The products of these genes, when mutated, produce gaps in a rather uniform arrangement of cells. These gaps will result in the loss of a body segment in the developing embryo, causing a gap in the normal body plan. Therefore, each gap gene is critical for the development of a section of the organism. Each gap gene is expressed in a vertical band or segment in the early embryo. This segment correlates with the region that is absent in the mutant ( Figure below ).

One example of a gap gene is the Krüppel gene, which regulates the activity of a number of other genes. Krüppel literally means "cripple" in German, named for the crippled appearance of mutant larva. Gap genes are defined by the effect of a mutation in that gene, and Krüppel is one such effect. Other gap genes are known as tailless and knirps (a "squirt or whippersnapper"). Gap genes encode transcription factors which directly effect the expression of additional genes involved in embryo segmentation, called the pair-rule genes . Pair-rule genes are expressed in alternating segments within the developing embryo. Pair-rule genes have very creative names, such as even-skipped, hairy, odd-skipped, odd-paired, sloppy paired and fushi tarazu , which is Japanese for “few segments.” See My favorite silly gene names at http://www.itsokaytobesmart.com/post/82318778810/funny-gene-names for a list of other interesting gene names.

Gap genes control the expression of other genes within specific regions of cells in the developing organism. This allows specific genes to be expressed in certain cells at the appropriate stage of development.





Complex Regulation


Gap genes themselves are under the effect of maternal effect genes, such as bicoid and nanos. Gap genes also regulate each other to achieve their precise striped expression patterns. The maternal effect is when the phenotype of offspring is partly determined by the phenotype of its mother, irrespective of genotype. This often occurs when the mother supplies mRNA or proteins to the egg, affecting early development. In developing Drosophila, maternal effects include axis determination.

The bicoid maternal effect gene is transcribed in the nurse cells of the mother and then the mRNA is transferred to the oocyte. Mutant embryos from homozygous mutant bicoid mothers fail to produce head and thorax structures.



Figure 9.42

Gap gene expression. Shown is the expression pattern of four gap genes, Krüppel, Giant, Knirps, and Tailless, in a developing Drosophilia embryo. Note how the expression of these genes creates an unique pattern resulting in gaps in what was a rather uniform arrangement of cells.



The bicoid protein activates a number of gap genes. Bicoid encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, and is expressed in a gradient within the embryo. Bicoid positions gap and pair rule gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing Drosophila embryo.

The intricate and complex regulation of these developmental genes is demonstrated by the regulation of the Krüppel gene. Like other gap genes, Krüppel is specifically expressed in certain segments of the developing embryo. This gene is up and down regulated by five proteins: bicoid, hunchback, tailless, knirps and giant. Krüppel is activated when the bicoid protein gradient declines steeply at the central part of the embryo, and inhibited by high levels of hunchback, and high levels of giant and tailless, which establishes the anterior boundary of Krüppel expression. Krüppel is also inhibited by knirps and activated by low levels of bicoid and low levels of hunchback, which establishes the posterior boundary of Krüppel expression.

Transcription Factors


Transcription factors are proteins that bind to regulatory elements on the DNA and have a significant role in the regulation of gene expression . Hence, one domain of many transcription factors is a DNA-binding domain. Transcription factors can activate or repress gene expression. In eukaryotic genes, transcription factors usually must bind to a gene's promoter prior to the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription. This ensures that a gene is only expressed when its product is needed by the cell. See http://www.broadinstitute.org/education/glossary/transcription-factor for a brief description.

In eukaryotes, an important class of transcription factors is called general transcription factors (GTFs). These factors are necessary for transcription to occur. Many of these GTFs are part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with RNA polymerase directly. The most common GTFs are those that are involved in the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of DNA. These include the ubiquitous TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The preinitiation complex binds to promoter regions of DNA upstream to the gene that they regulate. TFIID is also known as the TATA binding protein as it binds to the TATA box.





DNA and Protein Interactions


DNA and proteins interact with each other for various reasons. Most of these reasons have to do with influencing the DNA structure or the expression of genes with in the DNA, a process known as gene expression. How the protein interacts with the DNA is based on the structure of the protein. Conserved DNA binding motifs are present among DNA binding proteins. These include domains known as the leucine zipper, the helix-turn-helix, the zinc finger and the helix-loop helix domains.

The leucine-zipper (or the basic leucine zipper) domain contains an alpha helix with a leucine at every 7 th amino acid. If two leucine zipper domains find one another, the leucines can interact like the teeth in a zipper, allowing the dimerization of two proteins. When binding to the DNA, the leucine residues bind to the sugar-phosphate backbone while the helices sit in the major grooves.

The helix-turn-helix is a major structural motif common in homeobox proteins involved the regulation of development. It is composed of two alpha helices joined by a short strand of amino acids.

The zinc finger domain consists of a DNA recognition helix and two antiparallel beta sheet structures. It is stabilized by coordinating zinc ions with regularly spaced zinc-coordinating histidine or cysteine residues. The Krüppel gap gene (see the Regulation of Gene Expression: Eukaryotic (Advanced) concept) is a zinc-finger protein.

The helix-loop-helix domain is characterized by two alpha helices connected by a loop, allowing DNA binding.





Specific Transcription Factors


Specific transcription factors are factors that are specific for regulating specific genes. They are not ubiquitous for all RNA polymerase II associated genes. Specific factors vary considerably depending on the cis-regulatory sequences associated with the promoter region of a gene.

Examples of specific transcription factors Factor Structural type Recognition sequence Binds as

Sp1* Zinc finger 5'-GGGCGG-3' Monomer

AP-1* Basic zipper 5'-TGA(G/C)TCA-3' Dimer

C/EBP* Basic zipper 5'-ATTGCGCAAT-3' Dimer

Heat shock factor Basic zipper 5'-XGAAX-3' Trimer

ATF/CREB* Basic zipper 5'-TGACGTCA-3' Dimer

c-Myc Basic helix-loop-helix 5'-CACGTG-3' Dimer

Oct-1 Helix-turn-helix 5'-ATGCAAAT-3' Monomer

NF-1* Novel 5'-TTGGCXXXXXGCCAA-3' Dimer

Sp1 = specificity protein 1

AP-1 = activator protein 1

C/EBP = CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein

ATF/CREB = activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding

NF-1 = Nuclear factor I





Specificity Protein 1


Specificity Protein 1 , or Sp1, is involved in the early development of an organism. Sp1 directly binds DNA through a zinc finger motif. Sp1 binds to a regulatory sequence with the consensus sequence 5'-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)-3', which is known as a GC box element. Sp1 was first identified in 1983, making it one of the earliest transcription factors identified. It belongs to a family of transcription known as the Sp/KLF family (specificity protein/Krüppel-like factor).





Activator Protein 1


AP-1, activator protein 1 , is also one of the earliest transcription factors identified. It activates the transcription of genes in response to a number of stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, stress, and bacterial and viral infections, resulting in altered cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. AP-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of proteins belonging to the c-Fos, c-Jun, ATF and JDP families. c-Fos is a cellular proto-oncogene; it belongs to the leucine zipper family of transcription factors. c-fos gene products dimerize with c-jun gene products through the leucine zipper to form AP-1. AP-1 activates transcription of genes containing the TPA DNA response element 5'-TGAGCTCA-3'. TPA, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is a phorbol ester, a potent tumor promoter known to activate the signal transduction enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) . PKC describes a family of protein kinase enzymes that are involved in controlling the function of other proteins through the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on those proteins.

ATF and JDP are two other classes of proteins that may dimerize with for or jun to form AP-1. ATF, activating transcription factor, is a class of AP-1 transcription factor dimers. JDP, or Jun dimerization protein is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors.





CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein


CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins , or C/EBPs form a family of transcription factors that bind to the CCAAT box motif. They are characterized by a highly conserved basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is used to form protein dimers. C/EBPs are involved in different cellular responses, such as in the control of cellular proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and in metabolism and immunity.





c-Myc


Myc is a transcription factor that activates expression of many genes through binding to a specific cis-regulatory sequence. In the human genome, Myc is believed to regulate expression of 15% of all genes through binding to Enhancer Box sequences (E-boxes) with the consensus sequence CANNTG. The myc family of transcription factors contain bHLH/LZ (basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper) domains. The myc protein, through its bHLH domain can bind to DNA, while the leucine zipper domain allows the dimerization with its partner,known as Max, another bHLH transcription factor. A mutated version of Myc is found in many cancers. The constitutive expression of the myc gene leads excess myc protein and to the unregulated expression of many additional genes, some of which are involved in cell proliferation, resulting in the formation of cancer.

Gene Regulation and Cancer - Advanced


Discuss gene regulation in terms of the development of cancer.





What controls a growing tumor?

There are two main types of genes involved in cancer formation. Mutations in these genes lead to the development of cancer. One type of gene, a pro to-oncogene, is normally a transcription factor. When transcription does not occur properly, detrimental effects can result.





Regulation of Gene Expression in Cancer


Carcinogenesis is the process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is also known as oncogenesis or tumorigenesis and it depends on both the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of tumor suppressor genes . Proto-oncogenes, the non-cancerous normal version of an oncogene, can be a transcription factor like c-fos, c-jun and c-myc, or a gene whose product is involved in signal transduction, leading to altered gene expression. When mutations cause the regulation of this process to be disturbed, cell proliferation can be enhanced leading to tumorigenesis.

At least two separate mutations are necessary to develop cancer. For example, a mutation in a proto-oncogene would not necessarily lead to cancer, as normally functioning tumor suppressor genes would counteract the effects of the oncogene. It is the second mutation in the tumor suppressor gene that could lead to uncontrolled cell growth and possibly cancer. Gene expression, signal transduction, the cell cycle and oncogenes seem to have an interconnected relationship with each other inside the cell. Both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play an important role in gene regulation and cell proliferation ( Figure below ). As stated above, numerous oncogenes are involved in gene expression. Signal transduction pathways are filled with proteins involved in ultimately altering gene expression (see the Cell Communication: Signal Transduction (Advanced) concept). Anytime one of the involved proteins is altered, such as when its gene is mutated, gene expression can be altered.



Figure 9.43

How Cancer Develops. This flow chart shows how a series of mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes leads to cancer.





Oncogenes


The products of proto-oncogenes are required for normal growth, repair and homeostasis. However, when these genes are mutated, they turn into oncogenes and play a role in the development of cancer. Proto-oncogenes may be growth factors, transcription factors, or other proteins involved in regulation. A very common oncogene, ras , is normally a regulatory GTPase that switches a signal transduction chain on and off. Ras and Ras-related proteins are products of oncogenes found in 20% to 30% of human tumors. The transcription factor myc is an oncogene often seen mutated in Burkitt’s lymphoma, a rare type of lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphocytes.

Ras is a G protein , a regulatory GTP hydrolase that cycles between an activated and inactivated form. When a growth factor binds to its receptor on the outside of the cell, a signal is relayed to Ras. As a G protein, Ras is activated when GTP is bound to it. The active Ras then passes the signal to a series of protein kinases, regulatory proteins that eventually activate transcription factors to alter gene expression and produce proteins that stimulate the cell cycle ( Figure below ). One important recipient of Ras signaling is the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) . Once activated, MAPK transmit signals downstream to other protein kinases and gene regulatory proteins. This cascade of reactions is typical of a signal transaction pathway.

Many of the genes and proteins involved in signal transduction pathways are interconnected to Ras. Any mutation that makes Ras more active or otherwise interrupts the normal signal transduction pathways ( Figure below ) may result in excessive cell division and cancer.

In Living things share common genes at http://www.dnaftb.org/40/animation.html , Michael Wigler discusses his work on ras, and 1989 Nobel Prize awardees Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop discuss their work retroviruses.





Tumor Suppressor Genes


Tumor suppressor genes, as their name implies, normally suppress tumorigenesis. When this process is disturbed, such as by a mutation, tumor suppression may not be inhibited as normal. An example of a tumor suppressor gene is p53 , which encodes a 53,000 dalton (53kd) protein, The p53 gene is activated by DNA damage. DNA may be damaged by ultraviolet light, and any damaged DNA may be harmful to the cell. Mutations causing problems with any of the components of Figure below , may lead to the development of cancer. So that damaged DNA is not replicated, the cell cycle must be temporarily stopped so that the DNA can be repaired. The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of cell cycle inhibiting proteins ( Figure below ). p53 often activates a gene named p21, whose protein product temporarily stops the cell cycle. If the DNA can not be repaired, p53 activates other genes that lead to cell death, or apoptosis. This prevents the cell from passing on damaged DNA. If the p53 tumor suppressor gene is defective, as by mutation, DNA damage in the cell may accumulate and the cell may survive to replicate the damaged DNA. The damaged DNA would then be passed to other cells through many cell divisions, and cancer could develop.



Figure 9.44

Signal transduction pathways. Ras (upper middle section) activates a number of pathways but an especially important one seems to be the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). MAPK transmit signals downstream to other protein kinases and gene regulatory proteins. Note that many of these pathways are initiated when a signal binds to its receptor outside the cell. Most pathways end with altered gene regulation and cell proliferation. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is shown at the lower section of the figure stimulating p21. The interrelated complexity of the pathways demonstrate the significant role these play in the cell.

Biotechnology - Advanced


Introduction




Biotechnology. Gene Therapy. Designer plants. Designer babies. Reality or fiction? During your lifetime, gene therapy may be mainstream medicine. Here we see a representation of the insertion of DNA into the nucleus of a cell. Is this possible? Yes. In these concepts, you will learn how human, animal and plant chromosomes and genes are manipulated to make our lives better. But what does it mean "to make our lives better." Does this not just include curing genetic diseases, but also improving crops? Biotechnology has created a number of very important ethical issues that will be discussed for many years to come. Some uses of biotechnology are fact, others will always be fiction.

"Without question, man's knowledge of man is undergoing the greatest revolution since Leonardo. In many ways, personalized medicine is already here." Dr. Francis Collins, Director, The National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.





Biotechnology - Advanced


Describe what is meant by Biotechnology and DNA technology?

Describe DNA sequencing.





So how does a scientist work with DNA?

It usually starts with the sequence of As, Cs, Gs and Ts. Once the sequence is known, so much more can be done. Specific regions can be isolated, cloned, amplified, and analyzed. In fact, the ability to amplify a specific region of DNA has revolutionized biological research. And all of this is done to directly or indirectly help us.





Biotechnology


Is it really possible to clone people? Another question is, should we clone people? Are scientific fantasies, such as depicted on TV shows such as Star Trek or in the movie GATTACA , actually a possibility? Who can really say? How, really, will science affect our future? The answers partially lie in the field of biotechnology.

Biotechnology is technology based on biological applications. These applications are increasingly used in medicine, agriculture and food science. Biotechnology combines many features of biology, including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology, and cell biology. Many aspects of biotechnology center around DNA and its applications, otherwise known as DNA technology. We could devote a whole textbook to current applications of biotechnology, however, we will focus on the applications towards medicine and agriculture, and the extension into the forensic sciences. First, though, we need to understand DNA technology.





DNA Technology


What is DNA technology? Is it using and manipulating DNA to help people? Is it using DNA to make better medicines and individualized treatments? Is it analyzing DNA to determine predispositions to genetic diseases? The answers to these questions, and many more, is yes. And the answers to many of these issues begin with the Human Genome Project.

Scientists have sequenced a consensus version of the human genome. Now what? Do we know what all the genes are or what they do? Not yet. Do we know what phenotypes are associated with mutations in the genes? For many genes, or even most genes, we do not. Do we even know exactly how many genes we have? Not exactly. And we are far away from knowing what, at the genomic level, makes us all unique. So how does this information help us? The Human Genome Project has been labeled a landmark scientific event. But what can we do with this information? More on the Human Genome Project will be discussed in the DNA Technology: The Human Genome Project (Advanced) concept.

There are many applications of genetic information, including applications in medicine and agriculture. The applications of genetics to forensic science have become one of the most important aspects of the criminal justice system. And of course, these applications raise many ethical questions. See Genes can be moved between species at http://www.dnaftb.org/34/animation.html to see Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer speak about developing recombinant DNA technology. See Different genes are active in different kinds of cells at http://www.dnaftb.org/36/animation.html for more recent molecular technologies.

DNA Sequencing


For years, arguably beginning with the rediscovery of Mendel's work in the early 1900s, scientists have known about heritable factors or genes. Then in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was proved that DNA is the genetic material and has a triplet code made of just four bases, understanding the sequence of this code became the next significant endeavor. How do you sequence the ACGTs? The genetic code told us of the amino acids coded for by each codon, but it also told us that multiple codons could code for the same amino acid. Would sequencing the human genome explain to us what it means to be human? Maybe at a molecular level. But even prior to undertaking such a large effort, sequencing small parts, even just small segments of a gene, would form the basis of DNA analysis and DNA technology. But first methods to sequence DNA had to be developed.

Sequencing of DNA would allow the analysis of genes to become more feasible. How big is a gene? Where are the start and stop codons? Where are the intron and exon junctions? What is the gene's consensus sequence? What are significant base changes within a gene? These questions could start to be answered.

DNA sequencing was built upon earlier knowledge of DNA polymerases and DNA replication. The chain-termination method , which makes use of a "defective" DNA nucleotide, is the basis of DNA sequencing. This method is also known as the Sanger method, named after its developer Frederick Sanger. In this process, one strand of DNA is used as a template, just as in DNA replication. The nucleotide chain elongates as a deoxynucleotide (dNTP) is attached to the 3' carbon end of the chain based on the base-pair rules. At the chain termination method, dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) are utilized in the sequencing reaction. ddNTPs lack a 3'-OH group necessary for elongation. When a ddNTP is incorporated into the elongating chain, the elongation process stops at that base. When four separate sequencing reactions are done, one each in the presence of a particular ddNTP, and the products are separated by size through gel electrophoresis , the DNA sequence can be read. In A gene is a discrete sequence of DNA nucleotides at http://www.dnaftb.org/23/animation.html , Fred Sanger talks about developing DNA sequencing procedures.

Gene Cloning - Advanced


Describe gene cloning and the processes involved.





What does it mean to clone?

A genetically exact copy. A clone can be a gene, a cell, an animal or plant. And these clones are produced all the time. Theoretically, a clone could also be a human. But would that be a smart thing to do? Is it ethical? Is it even legal?





Gene Cloning


You probably have heard of cloning. A clone is a genetically exact copy. It can be a clone of a gene, a cell or an organism. Even a human. However, whereas cloning of humans has many ethical issues associated with it and is illegal throughout most of the world, the cloning of genes has been ongoing for well over 30 or 40 years, with cloning of animals occurring more recently. Gene cloning , also known as molecular cloning, refers to the process of isolating a DNA sequence of interest for the purpose of making multiple copies of it. The identical copies are clones. In 1973, Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer developed techniques to make recombinant DNA, a form of artificial DNA. They talk about their work in Genes can be moved between species at http://www.dnaftb.org/34/animation.html .

Recombinant DNA is engineered through the combination of two or more DNA strands, combining DNA sequences which would not normally occur together. In other words, selected DNA (or the DNA of "interest") is inserted into an existing organismal genome, such as a bacterial plasmid DNA, or some other sort of vector. The recombinant DNA can then be inserted into another cell, such as a bacterial cell, for amplification and possibly production of the resulting protein. This process is called transformation , the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the uptake, incorporation, and expression of foreign genetic material. Recombinant DNA technology was made possible by the discovery of restriction endonucleases.

In The RNA message is sometimes edited at http://www.dnaftb.org/24/animation.html , Rich Rioberts and Phil Sharp discuss the development of tools and techniques to analyze DNA.





Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Ligation


Restriction enzymes or restriction endonucleases are prokaryotic enzymes that recognize and cut DNA at specific sequences, called restriction sites. It is believed that they evolved as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA, such as viral DNA. Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been identified. Some of the more common restriction enzymes are shown in the table below, where up and down arrows show the sites of cleavage. Restriction enzymes are named based on the prokaryotic organism they are isolated from. For example, those isolated from Escherichia coli would begin with Eco. As the Table below shows, digestion with the restriction enzymes will result in overlapping or blunt ends. EcoRI produces overlapping "sticky" ends: the enzyme cleaves between the G and A on both strands. On the other hand, SmaII restriction enzyme cleavage produces "blunt" ends. The enzyme cleaves between the G and C on both strands.

Key: N = C or G or T or A

Cloning of a segment of DNA of interest can easily be carried out with restriction enzyme digestion, followed by ligation and transformation or transfection. In the classical restriction enzyme digestion and ligation cloning protocols, cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps:

isolation of the DNA of interest (or target DNA),

ligation,

transfection (or transformation), and

a screening/selection procedure.



For an overview of cloning, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRpfOfAadu8 .



Click on the image above for more content





Isolation of DNA


Initially, the DNA fragment to be cloned must be isolated. This DNA of interest may be a gene, part of a gene, a promoter, or another segment of DNA, and is frequently isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction enzyme digestion. As discussed above, a restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts double-stranded DNA at a specific sequence. The enzyme makes two incisions, one through each strand of the double helix, without damaging the nitrogenous bases. This produces either overlapping ends (also known as sticky ends) or blunt ends. The 1978 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Daniel Nathans and Hamilton Smith for the discovery of restriction endonucleases. The first practical use of their work was the manipulation of E. coli bacteria to produce human insulin for diabetics.





Ligation


Once the DNA of interest is isolated, a ligation procedure is necessary to insert the amplified fragment into a vector to produce the recombinant DNA molecule. Restriction fragments (or a fragment and a plasmid/vector) can be spliced together, provided their sticky ends are complementary. Blunt end ligation is also possible.

The plasmid or vector (which is usually circular) is digested with restriction enzymes, opening up the vector to allow insertion of the target DNA. If the isolated DNA of interest and the plasmid or vector are digested with the same restriction enzyme, their sticky ends will be complementary. The two DNAs are then incubated with DNA ligase , an enzyme that can attach together strands of DNA with double strand breaks. This produces a recombinant DNA molecule. Figure below depicts a plasmid with two additional segments of DNA ligated into the plasmid, producing the recombinant DNA molecule. Figure below depicts DNA before and after ligation.



Figure 10.1

(left) This image shows a line drawing of a plasmid. The plasmid is drawn as two concentric circles that are very close together representing the two strands of DNA, with two large segments and one small segment depicted. The two large segments (blue and green) indicate antibiotic resistances usually used in a screening procedure, and the small segment (red) indicates an origin of replication, used in DNA replication. The resulting DNA is a recombinant DNA molecule. (right) Sticky ends produced by restriction enzyme digestion can be joined with the enzyme DNA ligase.





Transfection and Selection


Following ligation, the recombinant DNA is placed into a host cell, usually bacterial, in a process called transfection or transformation. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. Many of these cultures may not contain a plasmid with the target DNA as the transfection process is not usually 100% successful, so the appropriate cultures with the DNA of interest must be selected. Many plasmids/vectors include selectable markers - usually some sort of antibiotic resistance ( Figure above ). When cultures are grown in the presence of an antibiotic, only bacteria transfected with the vector containing resistance to that antibiotic should grow. However, these selection procedures do not guarantee that the DNA of insert is present in the cells. Further analysis of the resulting colonies is required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of a process PCR or restriction fragment analysis, both of which need to be followed by gel electrophoresis and/or DNA sequencing (DNA sequence analysis).

DNA sequence analysis, PCR, or restriction fragment analysis will all determine if the plasmid/vector contains the insert. Restriction fragment analysis is digestion of isolated plasmid/vector DNA with restriction enzymes. If the isolated DNA contains the target DNA, that fragment will be excised by the restriction enzyme digestion. Gel electrophoresis will separate DNA molecules based on size and charge. Examples are shown in Figure below .





Gel Electrophoresis


Gel electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate DNA fragments by size and charge. Notice in Figure below that the "gels" are rectangular in shape. The gels are made of a gelatin-like material of either agarose or polyacrylamide. An electric field, with a positive charge applied at one end of the gel, and a negative charge at the other end, forces the fragments to migrate through the gel. DNA molecules migrate from negative to positive charges due to the net negative charge of the phosphate groups in the DNA backbone. Longer molecules migrate more slowly through the gel matrix. After the separation is completed, DNA fragments of different lengths can be visualized using a fluorescent dye specific for DNA, such as ethidium bromide. The resulting stained gel shows bands correspond to DNA molecules of different lengths, which also correspond to different molecular weights. Band size is usually determined by comparison to DNA ladders containing DNA fragments of known length. Gel electrophoresis can also be used to separate RNA molecules and proteins.

Use a machine. The polymerase chain reaction has revolutionized biological and biomedical research and applications. Luckily many machines have been developed that allow this process to be performed rapidly and with precision.





The Polymerase Chain Reaction


The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify specific regions of a DNA strand millions of times. A region may be a number of loci, a single gene, a part of a gene, or a non-coding sequence. This technique produces a useful quantity of DNA for analysis, be it medical, forensic or some other form of analysis. Amplification of DNA from as little as a single cell is possible. Whole genome amplification is also possible.

PCR utilizes a heat stable DNA polymerase, Taq polymerase (or Taq DNA polymerase), named after the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus, from which it was originally isolated. T. aquaticus is a bacterium that lives in hot springs and hydrothermal vents, and Taq polymerase is able to withstand the high temperatures required to denature DNA during PCR (discussed below). Taq polymerase’s optimum temperature for activity is between 75°C and 80°C. Recently other DNA polymerases have also been used for PCR.

A basic PCR involves a series of repeating cycles involving three main steps (see Figure below ):

Denaturation of the double stranded DNA.

Annealing of specific oligonucleotide primers.

Extension of the primers to amplify the region of DNA of interest.



These steps will be discussed in additional detail below.

The oligonucleotide primers are single stranded pieces of DNA that correspond to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the DNA region to be amplified. These primers will anneal to the corresponding segment of denatured DNA. Taq Polymerase, in the presence of free deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), will extend the primers to create double stranded DNA. After many cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension, the region between the two primers will be greatly amplified.

The PCR is commonly carried out in a thermal cycler, a machine that automatically allows heating and cooling of the reactions to control the temperature required at each reaction step (see below). The PCR usually consists of a series of about 30 to 35 cycles. Most commonly, PCR is carried out in three repeating steps, with some modifications for the first and last step.

PCR is usually performed in small tubes or wells in a tray, each often beginning with the complete genome of the species being studied. As only a specific sequence from that genome is of interest, the sequence specific primers are targeted to that sequence. PCR is done with all the building blocks necessary to create DNA: template DNA, primers, dNTPs, and a DNA polymerase.

The three basic steps of PCR ( Figure below ) are:

Denaturation step : This step is the first regular cycling event and consists of heating the reaction to 94 - 98°C for 30 to 60 seconds. It disrupts the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases of the DNA strands, yielding single strands of DNA.

Annealing step : The reaction temperature is lowered to 50-65°C for 30 to 60 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to the single-stranded DNA template. Stable hydrogen bonds form between the DNA strand (the template) and the primers when the primer sequence very closely matches the complementary template sequence. Primers are usually 17 - 22 nucleotides long and are carefully designed to bind to only one site in the genome. The polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA synthesis.

Extension step : A temperature of around 72°C is used for this step, which is close to the optimum temperature of Taq polymerase. At this step the Taq polymerase extends the primer by adding dNTPs, using one DNA strand as a template to create a the other (new) DNA strand. The extension time depends on the length of the DNA fragment to be amplified. As a standard, at its optimum temperature, the DNA polymerase will polymerize a thousand bases in one minute.





Figure 10.3

The Polymerase Chain Reaction. The polymerase chain reaction involves three steps. High temperatures are needed for the process to work. The enzyme Taq polymerase is used in step 3 because it can withstand high temperatures.



Utilizing PCR, DNA can be amplified millions of times to generate quantities of DNA that can be used for a number of purposes. These include the use of DNA for prenatal or genetic testing, such as testing for a specific mutation. PCR has revolutionized the fields of biotechnology, human genetics, and a number of other sciences. Many of the applications will be discussed in the additional concepts. PCR was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. Due to the importance of this process and the significance it has had on scientific research, Dr. Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, just 10 years after his discovery. See http://www.dnalc.org/resources/spotlight/ for animations of Dr. Mullis and PCR.

To say that PCR, molecular cloning and the Human Genome Project has revolutionized biology and medicine would be an understatement. These efforts have led to numerous accolades, including Nobel prizes, and more may follow. Some of the ways that these discoveries have shaped our lives are the focus of the Concept Biotechnology (Advanced) concepts.

The Human Genome Project - Advanced


What is the Human Genome Project?

Describe the goals and the importance of the Human Genome Project.





Why is understanding the whole human genome important?

That's over 3,000,000,000 pieces of information.

The Human Genome Project was one of the great feats of exploration in history - an inward voyage of discovery rather than an outward exploration of the planet or the cosmos; an international research effort to sequence and map all of the genes - together known as the genome - of members of our species, Homo sapiens. Completed in April 2003, the HGP gave us the ability to, for the first time, to read nature's complete genetic blueprint for building a human being. - National Human Genome Research Institute ( http://www.genome.gov/10001772 ).





The Human Genome Project


The Human Genome


All the DNA of the human species makes up the human genome . This DNA consists of about 3 billion base pairs and is divided into thousands of genes on 23 pairs of chromosomes. The human genome also includes regulatory and noncoding sequences of DNA, as shown in Figure below .



Figure 10.4

Human Genome, Chromosomes, and Genes. Each chromosome of the human genome contains many genes as well as noncoding intergenic (between genes) regions. Each pair of chromosomes is shown here in a different color.



In A genome is an entire set of genes at http://www.dnaftb.org/39/animation.html , James Watson discusses the human genome and the Human Genome Project.





The Human Genome Project


Thanks to the Human Genome Project (HGP) , scientists now know a consensus DNA sequence of the entire human genome. The Human Genome Project was an international project that includes scientists from around the world. It began in 1990, and by 2003, scientists had sequenced all 3 billion base pairs of human DNA. Now they are trying to identify and characterize all the genes in the genome.

If we are all 99.9% genetically identical, what makes us different? How does that 0.1% make us tall or short, light or dark, develop cancer or not? To understand that 0.1%, we also need to understand the other 99.9%. Understanding the human genome is the goal of the Human Genome Project. This project, publicly funded by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) ( Figure below ); and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) , part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , may be one of the landmark scientific events of our lifetime.

As stated above, the goal of the HGP is to understand the genetic make-up of the human species by determining the DNA sequence of the human genome ( Figure below ) and the genome of a few model organisms. However, it is not just determining the 3 billion bases; it is understanding what they mean. How many human genes are there? Do these genes encode transcription factors, transport proteins, growth factors, structural proteins, or oncogenes? Or any of the other various types of proteins? Does a base change in the consensus sequence of a gene cause a genetic disease? What is the phenotype associated with mutations in a specific gene? Because of the HGP, these questions can be addressed.

The genes in the genome are in the process of being identified and characterized, as are the proteins associated with those genes. A preliminary estimate of the number of genes in the human genome is around 22,000 to 23,000.



Figure 10.5

(left) The Human Genome Project logo of the DOE. (right) A depiction of DNA sequence analysis. Note the 4 colors utilized, each representing a separate base.



The sequence of the human DNA is stored in databases available to anyone on the Internet. The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) , part of the NIH, as well as comparable organizations in Europe and Japan, maintain the genomic sequences in a database known as GenBank . Protein sequences are also maintained in this database. The sequences in these databases are the combined sequences of anonymous donors, and as such do not yet address the individual differences that make us unique. However, the known sequence does lay the foundation to identify the unique differences among all of us. Most of the currently identified variations among individuals will be single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs. A SNP (pronounced "snip") is a DNA sequence variation occurring at a single nucleotide in the genome. For example, two sequenced DNA fragments from different individuals, GGATCTACCGAA to GGATTTACCGAA, contain a difference in a single nucleotide. If this base change occurs in a gene, the base change then results in two alleles: the C allele and the T allele. Remember an allele is an alternative form of a gene. Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. The effect of these SNPs on protein structure and function, and any effect on the resulting phenotype, is an extensive field of study.

ENCODE: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements


In September 2012, ENCODE, The Enc yclopedia o f D NA E lements, was announced. ENCODE was a colossal project, involving over 440 scientists in 32 labs the world-over, whose goal was to understand the human genome. It had been thought that about 80% of the human genome was "junk" DNA. ENCODE has established that this is not true. Now it is thought that about 80% of the genome is active. In fact, much of the human genome is regulatory sequences, on/off switches that tell our genes what to do and when to do it. Dr. Eric Green, director of the NHGRI, which organized this project, states, "It's this incredible choreography going on, of a modest number of genes and an immense number of ... switches that are choreographing how those genes are used."

It is now thought that at least three-quarters of the genome is involved in making RNA, and most of this RNA appears to help regulate gene activity. Scientists have also identified about 4 million sites where proteins bind to DNA and act in a regulatory capacity. These new findings demonstrate that the human genome has remarkable and precise, and complex, controls over the expression of genetic information within a cell.

Biotechnology and Medicine - Advanced


Describe various applications of biotechnology as related to medicine.

How is DNA technology related to genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis?





Is this possible?

Of course DNA is much smaller than shown here and you cannot see it in a test tube. But you can manipulate and study DNA. Biotechnology and its associated techniques have made DNA-based biomedical research and analysis fairly routine.





Applications of DNA Technology: Medicine


Biotechnology and DNA technology could be considered synonymous. So much of biotechnology is DNA based. Remember that biotechnology is technology based on biological applications. Since the completion of the human genome project, the data produced from the project and the tools and technologies associated with the project have led to numerous biotechnology applications.

As discussed in the DNA Technology: The Human Genome Project (Advanced) concept, the Human Genome Project has opened up many avenues to take advantage of what we know about our genome in order to help us. Many of these possibilities are medically related. Others will be legally related. And yet still other uses of DNA technology include those involving other genomes, especially in agriculture and the food sciences. However, it is the medical possibilities of biotechnology that most people associate with helping humans.





Gene Therapy


Understanding and curing genetic diseases is the ultimate goal of human geneticists. As discussed in the Human Genetics: Diagnosis and Treatment (Advanced) concept, gene therapy is the insertion of a new gene into an individual’s cells and tissues to treat a disease, replacing a mutant disease-causing allele with a normal, non-mutant allele. Of course, the findings of the Human Genome Project are significant in determining the disease-causing alleles. Geneticists must know which are mutant alleles and which are non-mutant or "normal" alleles. They must also be able to identify alleles that are not just associated with a particular disease phenotype, but cause a disease phenotype. And of course, scientists must develop and test the technology to replace mutant alleles.





Recombinant Insulin


In the 1920s, there was no known way to produce insulin, which was needed by people to remove excess sugar from the bloodstream. People with diabetes either lack insulin, produce low levels of insulin, or are resistant to insulin, and thus they may need external insulin to control blood glucose levels. This problem was solved, at least temporarily, when it was found that insulin from a pig’s pancreas could be used in humans. This method was the primary solution for diabetes until recently. The problem with insulin from pigs was that there were not enough pigs to provide the quantities of insulin needed. Scientists needed to devise another way to produce insulin. This led to one of the biggest breakthroughs in recombinant DNA technology: the cloning of the human insulin gene.

By methods discussed the DNA Technology: Gene Cloning (Advanced) concept, the specific gene sequence that codes for human insulin was introduced into the bacteria E. coli . The transformed gene altered the genetic makeup of the bacterial cells, such that in a 24 hour period, billions of E. coli containing the human insulin gene resulted. Once the recombinant human protein was isolated from the bacteria, enough insulin was available to be administered to patients.

Though the production of human insulin by recombinant DNA procedures is an extremely significant event, many other aspects of DNA technology are beginning to become reality. In medicine, modern biotechnology provides significant applications in such areas as pharmacogenomics, genetic testing (and prenatal diagnosis), and gene therapy. These applications use our knowledge of biology to improve our health and our lives. Many of these medical applications are based on the findings of the Human Genome Project.

Pharmacogenomics


Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the genetic inheritance of an individual affects his or her body’s response to drugs. In other words, pharmacogenomics will lead to the design and production of drugs that are adapted to each person’s genetic makeup. Pharmacogenomics has applications in illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, depression, attention deficit disorders, HIV, asthma, and diabetes, among others.

Pharmacogenomics will result in the following benefits:

Development of tailor-made medicines. Using pharmacogenomics, pharmaceutical companies will be able to create drugs based on the proteins, enzymes and RNA molecules that are associated with specific genes and diseases. These tailor-made drugs promise not only to maximize the beneficial effects of the medicine, but also to decrease damage to nearby healthy cells.

More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages. Knowing a patient’s genetics will enable doctors to determine how well his or her body can process and metabolize a medicine. This will allow doctors to prescribe the proper levels of the medicine, allowing the medicine to have optimal results.

Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process. Once the genes and proteins associated with a disease are known, the discovery of new medicines will be made easier using these genes and proteins as targets for the medicine. In addition to creating much more beneficial medicines, this could significantly shorten the drug discovery process.

Better vaccines. Safer vaccines can be designed and produced by organisms transformed with DNA sequences from an antigen. These vaccines will trigger the immune response without the risks of infection. They will be capable of being engineered to carry several strains of pathogen at once, combining several vaccines into one.





Cytochrome P450 Genes


There are several known genes which are largely responsible for variances in drug metabolism and response among humans. The most common are the cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, which encode enzymes that influence the metabolism of more than 75% of current prescription drugs. CYP450 proteins are hemoproteins, belonging to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme cofactor. Often, these proteins form part of multi-component electron transfer chains, called P450-containing systems. The letter in P450 represents the word pigment, as these enzymes are red because of their heme group. The number 450 reflects the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme. Humans have 57 genes (and more than 59 pseudogenes) divided among 18 families of cytochrome P450 genes and 43 subfamilies. Some examples are shown in the Table below . CYP genes and enzymes are designated with the abbreviation CYP, followed by a number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene.

CYP Genes and Alleles Family Function Members Names

CYP1 drug and steroid (especially estrogen) metabolism 3 subfamilies, 3 genes, 1 pseudogene CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1

CYP2 drug and steroid metabolism 13 subfamilies, 16 genes, 16 pseudogenes CYP2A6, CYP2A7, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2F1, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP2S1, CYP2U1, CYP2W1

CYP3 drug and steroid (including testosterone) metabolism 1 subfamily, 4 genes, 2 pseudogenes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP3A43

CYP4 arachidonic acid or fatty acid metabolism 6 subfamilies, 12 genes, 10 pseudogenes CYP4A11, CYP4A22, CYP4B1, CYP4F2, CYP4F3, CYP4F8, CYP4F11, CYP4F12, CYP4F22, CYP4V2, CYP4X1, CYP4Z1

CYP7 bile acid biosynthesis 7-alpha hydroxylase of steroid nucleus 2 subfamilies, 2 genes CYP7A1, CYP7B1

CYP11 steroid biosynthesis 2 subfamilies, 3 genes CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2

CYP21 steroid biosynthesis 2 subfamilies, 1 gene, 1 pseudogene CYP21A2

CYP24 vitamin D degradation 1 subfamily, 1 gene CYP24A1

CYP46 cholesterol 24-hydroxylase 1 subfamily, 1 gene CYP46A1

How are these CYP genes important in individualized medicine ? These genes, like all genes, have multiple alleles. As these enzymes are involved in drug metabolism, different alleles can have different effectiveness at that metabolism.

For example, the CYP1A1 gene has 13 known alleles, known as CYP1A1*1, CYP1A1*2A, CYP1A1*2B, CYP1A1*3, CYP1A1*4 and so on. CYP1A1*1 is the wild type allele, and the others are usually due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The CYP2D6 gene has over 100 known alleles. CYP2D6*1A is the wild type allele and the others are variations on the *1A sequence. Some have a single SNP change, while other alleles have multiple base changes. There are six separate CYP2D6*1 alleles within this gene family.

If a person receives one *1 allele each from his/her mother and his/her father to code for the CYP2D6 gene, then that person is considered to have an extensive metabolizer (EM) phenotype. An extensive metabolizer is considered the normal phenotype with average enzyme activity levels. Other CYP metabolism phenotypes include: intermediate, ultra-rapid, and poor. These phenotypes are due to allelic variation among the CYP genes. However, with myriad possibilities of allelic combinations, this developing individualized medicine guidelines is still well under development.

CYP2D6 Allele and Enzyme Activity Allele CYP2D6 Activity Metabolizer Phenotype

CYP2D6*1 normal extensive

CYP2D6*2 increased ultra-rapid

CYP2D6*3 no activity poor

CYP2D6*4 no activity poor

CYP2D6*5 no activity poor

CYP2D6*9 decreased intermediate

CYP2D6*10 decreased intermediate

CYP2D6*17 decreased intermediate





KQED: Pharmacogenomics


We know that, thanks to our genome, each of us is phenotypically unique. Some of those differences are obvious, like eye and hair color, but others are not obvious at all, such as how our bodies react to medication. As discussed above, the CYP450 alleles have plenty to do with how each of us react to drugs. Researchers are beginning to look at how to individualize medical treatments, based on our genetic profiles. Some of the biggest breakthroughs have been in cancer treatment. For additional information on this personalized medicine, listen to http://www.kqed.org/quest/radio/personalized-medicine and see http://www.kqed.org/quest/blog/2009/09/11/reporters-notes-personalized-medicine/ . Personalized medicine is a drug treatment regimen individually developed to an individual based on that person's genetic profile.





Genetic Testing and Prenatal Diagnosis


Let's propose a hypothetical situation: unfortunately, members of your family are predisposed to develop a debilitating genetic disease. You and your spouse want to have a baby, but you want to know the likelihood of the child developing the disease.

This scenario could happen to anyone. As we learn more and more about disease causing genes, it will become easier to test for mutations in those genes. Currently, is there any way to determine if a baby will develop a disease due to a known mutation? Is it possible to screen for a mutation in a developing baby? The answer to both those questions is…yes.

Genetic testing involves the direct examination of DNA sequences. A scientist scans, by any number of methods, a patient’s DNA for mutated sequences. Genetic testing can be used to:

Diagnose a disease.

Confirm a diagnosis.

Provide information about the course of a disease.

Confirm the existence of a disease.

Predict the risk of future development of a disease in otherwise healthy individuals or their children.

Identify carriers (unaffected individuals who are heterozygous for a recessive disease gene).

Perform prenatal diagnostic screening.

Perform newborn screening.



Consultations with human geneticists and genetic counselors are an important first step in genetic testing. They will most likely prescribe some sort of prenatal screening (see the Human Genetics: Diagnosis and Treatment (Advanced) concept). Prenatal screening (also known as prenatal diagnosis or prenatal testing) is the testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Methods may involve amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to remove fetal cells. DNA can be isolated from these cells and analyzed. If the mutation that results in the phenotype is known, that specific base can be analyzed, either through restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or, more likely, through PCR and DNA sequence analysis. As it is the baby’s DNA that is being analyzed, the analysis will determine if the developing baby will have the mutation and develop the phenotype, or not have the mutation. Parents can then be informed of the probability of the baby developing the disease.

In human genetics, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PIGD) is genetic analysis performed on embryos prior to implantation. PIGD is considered an alternative to prenatal diagnosis. Its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination, as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease in question. In PIGD, in vitro fertilization is used to obtain embryos for analysis. DNA is isolated from developing embryos prior to implantation, and specific genetic loci are screened for mutations, usually using PCR based analysis. Embryos that lack the specific mutation can then be implanted into the mother, thereby guaranteeing that the developing baby will not have the specific mutation analyzed for (and thus not have the disease associated with that mutation).

Summary


In medicine, modern biotechnology provides significant applications in such areas as pharmacogenomics, genetic testing (prenatal diagnosis), and gene therapy.

Pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology and genomics, is the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics.

Pharmacogenomics will result in the following benefits:



Development of tailor-made medicines.

More accurate methods of determining appropriate drug dosages.

Improvements in the drug discovery and approval process.

Better vaccines.



Genetic testing involves the direct examination of DNA sequences.

Genetic testing can be used to: diagnose a disease; confirm a diagnosis; provide prognostic information about the course of a disease; confirm the existence of a disease; predict the risk of future development of a disease in otherwise healthy individuals or their children; screen for carriers (unaffected individuals who are heterozygous for a disease gene); perform prenatal diagnostic screening; and perform newborn screening.

Biotechnology and Agriculture - Advanced


Describe various applications of biotechnology as related to agriculture.

Why is biotechnology so important in agriculture?





Why would anyone grow plants like this?

Developing better crops is a significant aspect of biotechnology. But what is meant by "better?" Crops that are resistant to damage from insects or droughts? Crops that taste better? Crops that last longer? Crops that can grow anywhere? How do you feed over 7,000,000,000 people? With biotechnology. Crops developed with biotechnology must have a significant role in the world's future. And it all starts in the lab.





Applications of DNA Technology: Agriculture


Biotechnology has many other useful applications besides those that are medically related. Many of these are in agriculture and food science. These include the development of transgenic crops - the placement of genes into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait. Benefits include:

Improved yield from crops.

Reduced vulnerability of crops to environmental stresses.

Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.

Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.

Reduced dependence on fertilizers, pesticides and other agrochemicals.

Production of vaccines.

Improved Yield from Crops


Using biotechnology techniques, one or two genes may be transferred into a crop to give a new trait to that crop. This is done in the hope of increasing its yield. However, these increases in yield have proved to be difficult to achieve. Current genetic engineering techniques work best for single gene effects - that is traits inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion. Many of the genetic characteristics associated with crop yield, such as enhanced growth, are controlled by a large number of genes, each of which just has a slight effect on the overall yield. There is, therefore, still much research, including plant genetic research, to be done in this area.





Reduced Vulnerability to Environmental Stresses


Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions. Drought can destroy crop yields, as can too much rain or floods. But what if crops could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions? Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses. For example, drought and excessively salty soil are two significant factors affecting crop productivity. But there are crops that can withstand these harsh conditions. Why? Probably because of that plant's genetics. So biotechnologists and plant geneticists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions, trying to identify and isolate the genes that control these beneficial traits. The genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope of producing the same phenotypes in those crops.

Thale cress ( Figure below ), a species of Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ), is a tiny weed that is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow and its genome has been extensively characterized. Scientists have identified a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that confers resistance to some environmental stresses. When this gene is inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold and heat far better than ordinary cells. If these preliminary results prove successful in larger trials, then At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments.

Researchers have also created transgenic rice plants that are resistant to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV). In Africa, this virus destroys much of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants more susceptible to fungal infections.



Figure 10.8

Thale cress.





Increased Nutritional Qualities of Crops


Maybe you’ve heard over and over that eating beans is good for you. True? Well, maybe. But what if it were genetically possible to increase the nutritional qualities of food? One would think that would be beneficial to society. So, can biotechnology be used to do just that? Scientists are working on modifying proteins in foods to increase their nutritional qualities. Also, proteins in legumes and cereals may be transformed to provide all the amino acids needed by human beings for a balanced diet.





Improved Taste, Texture or Appearance of Food


Have you ever gone to the grocery store, bought some fruit and never gotten around to eating it? Maybe you haven’t, but maybe your parents have. Modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage so that fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer with a still reasonable shelf life. This is extremely important in parts of the world where time from harvest to the consumer may be longer than in other areas. In addition to improving the taste, texture and appearance of fruit, it will also extend the usable life of the fruit. As the world population grows and grows, this may become a fairly important issue. Extending the life of fruit can expand the market for farmers in developing countries due to the reduction in spoilage. This has successfully been demonstrated with the tomato. The first genetically modified food product was a tomato which was transformed to delay its ripening. Researchers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam are currently working on developing other delayed ripening fruits, such as the papaya.





Reduced Dependence on Fertilizers, Pesticides and Other Agrochemicals


There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.



Figure 10.9

Kenyans examining genetically modified insect resistant transgenic Bt corn.



In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

In 2001, 626,000 square kilometers of transgenic crops were planted. Seventy-seven percent of the transgenic crops were developed for herbicide tolerance in soybean, corn, and cotton, 15% were Bt crops for insect resistance, and 8% were developed with genes for both insect resistance and herbicide tolerance in cotton and corn.





Production of Vaccines in Crop Plants


Most little children hate shots. And many children in parts of the world do not even have access to vaccines. But what if these vaccines were available in an edible form? Modern biotechnology is increasingly being applied for novel uses other than food. Banana trees and tomato plants have been genetically engineered to produce vaccines in their fruit. If future clinical trials prove successful, the advantages of edible vaccines would be enormous, especially for developing countries. The transgenic plants could be grown locally and cheaply. Edible vaccines would not require the use of syringes, which, in addition to being unpleasant, can be a source of infections if contaminated.

Scientists have created a transgenic purple tomato that contains a cancer-fighting compound and others that have high levels of antioxidants (see Figure below ). See http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/purple-tomato-debuts-‘indigo-rose’ for more information.

They are, but so are many other animals like sheep and goats. Cloning allows large animals to produce drugs or proteins that are useful in medicine.





Applications of DNA Technology: Animal Cloning


DNA technology has proved very beneficial to humans. Transgenic animals are animals that have incorporated a gene from another species into their genome. They are used as experimental models to perform phenotypic tests with genes whose function is unknown, or to generate animals that are susceptible to certain compounds or stresses for testing purposes. Other applications include the production of human hormones, such as insulin. Many times these animals are rodents, such as mice, or fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ). Fruit flies are extremely useful as genetic models to study the effects of genetic changes on development. GloFish are the first genetically modified animal to be sold as a pet and are transgenic zebrafish transfected with a natural fluorescence gene. Watch these fish at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cQLGKH2ojY or in the video below.

But transgenic animals just have one novel gene. What about an animal with a whole new genome? Could a clone , a genetically exact copy of an organism, be developed using techniques associated with biotechnology? It could be argued that human cloning is one of the inevitable outcomes of modern biotechnology. It "simply" involves the removal of the nucleus from a somatic cell and its placement into an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed. This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a "simple" procedure. But animal cloning is arguably a different story.





Dolly


In February 1997, Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute announced the successful cloning of a sheep named Dolly from the mammary glands of an adult female ( Figure below ) ( Nature 385 , 810-13, 1997). Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. The cloning of Dolly made it apparent to many that the techniques used to produce her could someday be used to clone human beings. This resulted in tremendous controversy because of its ethical implications. After cloning was successfully demonstrated by Dolly's creators, many other large mammals, including horses and bulls, were cloned. Dolly, however, was put down by lethal injection in February 2003. Prior to her death, Dolly had been suffering from lung cancer and crippling arthritis. Although most sheep like Dolly live to be 11 to 12 years of age, postmortem examination of Dolly seemed to indicate that, other than her cancer and arthritis, she appeared to be quite normal. Dolly was a mother to six lambs, bred through normal methods.

Cloning is now considered a promising tool for preserving endangered species.



Figure 10.11

Dolly the sheep. Dolly was the first large mammal to be cloned.



In animal cloning, the nucleus from a somatic cell is inserted into an egg cell in which the nucleus has been removed. This process called somatic cell nuclear transfer results in essentially a fertilized egg, a zygote produced in an artificial manner. The resulting cell is cultivated and after a few divisions, the developing ball of cells is placed into a surrogate mother's uterus where it is allowed to develop into a fetus. The developing fetus will be genetically identical to the donor of the original nucleus ( Figure below ).

See the Time magazine collection on cloning at http://www.time.com/time/archive/collections/0,21428,c_cloning,00.shtml .



Figure 10.12

Reproductive cloning: The nucleus is removed from a somatic cell and fused with a denucleated egg cell. The resulting cell may develop into a colony of cloned cells, which is placed into a surrogate mother. In therapeutic cloning, the resulting cells are grown in tissue culture; an animal is not produced, but genetically identical cells are produced.





Risks of Cloning


Producing a cloned animal is not an insignificant achievement. Most likely it has taken a significant effort by the group of scientists attempting to make the clone. Rarely do scientists publish or discuss the many cloning experiments that failed, or even in the successful clones, the issues that tend to arise later, during the animal's development to adulthood. Cloning animals shows us what might happen if we try to clone humans.





High Failure Rate


Producing a cone through somatic cell nuclear transfer is not every efficient. The success rate ranges from 0.1 percent to 3 percent, which means that for every 1000 tries, only one to 30 clones are made. In other words, there are 970 to 999 failures in every 1000 attempts. That's a tremendous failure rate. This failure rate may be due to a number of circumstances. Keep in mind that somatic cell nuclear transfer is an artificial process. It is not a natural process, and there may still be components of the fertilization and development process that are not well understood.

The enucleated egg and the transferred nucleus may not be compatible.

An egg with a newly transferred nucleus may not begin to divide or develop properly.

Implantation of the embryo into the surrogate mother might fail.

The pregnancy itself might fail.





Large Offspring Syndrome


Cloned animals that do survive tend to be much bigger at birth than their natural conceived animals of the same species. This is known as "Large Offspring Syndrome". Cloned animals with this syndrome have abnormally large organs, which can lead to breathing, blood flow and other associated problems. However this syndrome is unpredictable; it does not always occur, so scientists cannot predict which clones will be affected.





Abnormal Gene Expression


Though surviving clones have identical genomes to their "parent," are they truly clones? Will they express the necessary genes at the proper times? Gene expression is an extremely complicated and highly regulated cellular process (see the Regulation of Gene Expression (Advanced) concepts). One significant issue is to reprogram the transferred nucleus so that it thinks it is in the zygote, mimicking the natural processes that must be initiated at fertilization, including the expression of the appropriate genes. The cell must be programmed so that the genes that must be expressed in that zygote are truly expressed. The nucleus cannot think it is in a differentiated cell, such as the somatic cell it came from.

See Click and Clone at http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/tech/cloning/clickandclone/ to test your knowledge of somatic cell nuclear transfer.





Telomeric Differences


As cells divide, their chromosomes get shorter. This is because the telomeres, the DNA sequences at both ends of a chromosome, lose material every time the DNA is replicated. The older the animal is, the shorter its telomeres will be, because of the number of cell cycles the cells have been through This is a natural part of aging. So, what happens to the clone if its transferred nucleus is already fairly old? Will the shortened telomeres affect its development or lifespan? The answer is still unclear. But starting a new organisms with "old" DNA with shortened telomeres is bound to have some effects, at least in some clones. Some cloned animals may be affected, others may not. Dolly the sheep's chromosomes did have shorter telomere lengths than normal. This means that Dolly's cells were aging faster than the cells from a normal sheep.





Vocabulary


clone : A genetically identical copy; may be a gene, a cell or an organism; an organism that is genetically identical to its parent.



gene expression : The process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" to produce a functional gene product, such as an RNA molecule or a polypeptide/protein molecule.

Summary


Transgenic animals are animals that have incorporated a gene from another species into their genome.

Biotechnology and Forensic Science - Advanced


Describe various applications of biotechnology as related to forensic science.

Why is DNA analysis the most important tool of the forensic scientist?

Describe forensic STR analysis.





What's a fingerprint made of DNA?

DNA fingerprinting creates a pattern based on an individual's unique DNA. This can be used as an unique identifier for a person. As you can imagine, this would be a key tool of the forensic scientist.





Applications of DNA Technology: Forensic DNA Analysis


You know that DNA can be used to distinguish individuals from each other. You may have heard that DNA can also be used to match evidence and suspects and help solve crimes. This is demonstrated on shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation . But how is this done? How is a genetic fingerprint , or a DNA fingerprint , which is a DNA pattern unique to each individual (except identical twins), created? Genetic fingerprinting, or DNA fingerprinting, distinguishes between individuals of the same species using only samples of their DNA. DNA fingerprinting has thus become one of the most powerful tools of the forensic scientist, enabling law enforcement personnel to match biological evidence from crime scenes to suspects. As any two humans have the majority of their DNA sequence in common, those sequences which demonstrate high variability must be analyzed. This DNA analysis was first developed using DNA hybridization techniques, but now is almost exclusively PCR-based.

DNA fingerprinting was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys in 1985. Genetic fingerprinting exploits highly variable repeating sequences. Two categories of these sequences are microsatellites and minisatellites. Microsatellites , also known as short tandem repeats (STRs) , consist of adjacent repeating units of 2 - 10 bases in length, for example (GATC) n , where GATC is a tetranucleotide (4 base) repeat and n refers to the number of repeats. It is the number of repeating units at a given locus that is variable. An STR profile can be created for any individual by analyzing a series of STRs ( Figure below ). Two unrelated humans will be unlikely to have the same numbers of repeats at a given locus.

In STR profiling, PCR is used to obtain enough DNA to then detect the number of repeats at 13 specific loci. PCR products are separated by gel or capillary electrophoresis. (Capillary electrophoresis is similar to gel electrophoresis but uses a capillary tube filled with the gelatin material.) By examining enough STR loci and counting how many repeats of a specific STR sequence there are at a given locus, it is possible to create a unique genetic profile of an individual. STR analysis has become the prevalent analysis method for determining genetic profiles in forensic cases. It is possible to establish a match that is extremely unlikely to have arisen by coincidence, except in the case of identical twins, who will have identical genetic profiles. The polymorphisms (different in the number of repeats) displayed at each STR region will be shared by approximately 5 - 20% of individuals. When analyzing STRs at multiple loci, such as the 13 STRs analyzed in forensic DNA analysis, it is the unique combinations of these polymorphisms in an individual that makes this method unmatched as an identification tool. The more STR regions that are analyzed in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

Genetic fingerprinting is used in forensic science to match suspects to samples of blood, hair, saliva or semen, or other sources of DNA. It has also led to several exonerations of formerly convicted suspects. Genetic fingerprinting is also used for identifying human remains, testing for paternity, matching organ donors, studying populations of wild animals, and establishing the province or composition of foods. It has also been used to generate hypotheses on the pattern of human migration.





CODIS


In the United States, DNA fingerprint profiles generated from the 13 STR loci are stored in The National DNA Index (NDIS), part of CODIS , The Combined DNA Index System, maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As of June 2012, CODIS maintained over 9.7 million offender profiles, 1.1 million arrestee profiles and 436,000 forensic profiles. Profiles maintained in CODIS are compiled from both suspects and evidence, and therefore are used to help solve criminal cases. Also as of June 2012, CODIS has produced over 182,200 "hits," assisting in more than 174,600 investigations. See http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/ndis-statistics/ for additional information.

Profiles of missing persons are also maintained in CODIS. The true power of STR analysis is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 13 loci are independently assorted, the laws of probabilities can be applied. This means that if someone has the genotype of ABC at three independent loci, then the probability of having that specific genotype is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1 with 18 zeros after it) or more, that is, the chance of two samples matching by coincidence is greater than the number of people on the planet, or the number of people that have ever lived.



Figure 10.13

The CODIS loci analyzed by STR analysis. Notice they are spread over 14 chromosomes, and that two are on the X and Y chromosomes.



The development of PCR has enabled STR analysis to become the method of choice for DNA identification. Prior to PCR, other methods were utilized. These include restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and Southern blot analysis.





RFLP Analysis: Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism


Prior to the development of PCR, restriction enzyme digestion of DNA followed by Southern blot analysis was used for DNA fingerprinting. This analysis is based on the polymorphic nature of restriction enzyme sites among different individuals, hence restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) are formed after digestion of DNA with these enzymes. A Southern blot , named after its inventor Edwin Southern, is a method used to check for the presence of a specific DNA sequence in a DNA sample. Once an individual’s DNA is digested with a specific restriction enzyme, the resulting fragments are analyzed by Southern blot analysis. These fragments will produce a specific pattern for that individual. Southern blotting is also used for other molecular biology procedures, including gene identification and isolation. Other blotting methods that employ similar principles have been developed. These include the western blot and northern blot. These procedures analyze proteins and RNA, respectively.

RFLP and Southern blot analysis involved several steps:

First, the DNA being analyzed is cut into different-sized pieces using restriction enzymes.

The resulting DNA fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis.

Next, an alkaline solution or heat is applied to the gel so that the DNA denatures and separates into single strands.

Nitrocellulose paper is pressed evenly against the gel and then baked so the DNA is permanently attached to it. The DNA is now ready to be analyzed using a radioactive single-stranded DNA probe in a hybridization reaction.

After hybridization, excess probe is washed from the membrane, and the pattern of hybridization is visualized on X-ray film by autoradiography ( Figure below ).





Figure 10.14

Mutations can create or abolish restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites, thus affecting quantities and length of DNA fragments resulting from RE digestion.



Hybridization is when two genetic sequences bind together because of the hydrogen bonds that form between the base pairs. To make hybridization work, the radioactive probe has to be denatured so that it is single-stranded. The denatured probe and the Southern blot are incubated together, allowing the probe to bind to the corresponding fragment on the Southern blot. The probe will bond to the denatured DNA wherever it finds a fit. Hybridization of a probe made to a variable segment of DNA will produce a DNA fingerprint pattern specific for an individual. This procedure has a number of steps and is very labor intensive. PCR-based methods are much simpler.

Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues of Biotechnology - Advanced


Discuss some of the ELSI associated with biotechnology and the Human Genome Project.





Right or wrong? Good or bad? Legal or illegal?

The completion of The Human Genome Project is one of the most important scientific events of the past 50 years. However, is knowing all of our DNA a good thing? Could this tell a person if they are predisposed to develop a certain disease? Could this lead to types of discrimination? The advancement of biotechnology has raised many interesting "ethical, legal and social" questions.





Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues


Biotechnology will have a tremendous impact on our future - of this there is no doubt. Is society entering some dangerous areas? Well, many of these issues have never been analyzed until recently. With the discovery of countless amounts of genetic information and the development of its applications, many ethical, legal and social issues ( ELSI ) need to be addressed. The ability to sequence and analyze one's genome is both of tremendous value and tremendous concern.

Some ELSI issues (or questions) associated with the Human Genome Project are:

Who should have access to personal genetic information and how will it be used?

Who owns and controls genetic information?

How does personal genetic information affect an individual and society's perceptions of that individual?

How does genomic information affect members of minority communities?

How reliable and useful is fetal genetic testing?

How will genetic tests be evaluated and regulated for accuracy, reliability, and utility?

How do we prepare the public to make informed choices?

Should testing be performed when no treatment is available?

Should parents have the right to have their minor children tested for adult-onset diseases?

Are genetic tests reliable and interpretable by the medical community?

Where is the line between medical treatment and enhancement?

Are genetically modified foods and other products safe for humans and the environment?

How will these technologies affect developing nations' dependence on the West?

Who owns genes and other pieces of DNA?

Will patenting DNA sequences limit their accessibility and development into useful products?



Many of these questions will be argued for many years. Many of these questions can only be answered by the individual. Many of these questions need to be and are being addressed by governments.

Are scientific fantasies, such as those depicted on TV shows such as Star Trek or in the movie GATTACA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppWok6SX88 , a possibility? Who can really say? How, really, will biotechnology affect our future? It seems as if the possibilities are endless.

Rapid advances in DNA-based research, human genetics, and their applications have resulted in new and complex ethical and legal issues for society. ELSI programs that identify and address these implications have been an integral part of the Human Genome Project since its inception. These programs have resulted in a body of work that promotes education and helps guide the conduct of genetic research and the development of related medical and public policies.
