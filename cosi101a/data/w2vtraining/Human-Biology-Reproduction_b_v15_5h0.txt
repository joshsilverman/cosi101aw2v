Reproduction - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Reproduction




What is reproduction and why is it so difficult to talk about?

How old were you when you first wondered where babies come from? Who discussed it with you? What was the explanation?

Children used to be told many fanciful stories about babies (Figure 1.1). Now children are given more accurate explanations, but still often less than the full story.



Figure 1.1 “Where did I come from?”-“The stork brought you, dear.”

What Do You Think?

Why might young children have problems understanding the true nature of pregnancy?



Young children gradually understand reproduction, the process of producing young. Those younger than four years may think babies are made in some distant place (such as in a factory). Later, children may get the idea that a baby grows in the mother's stomach, like a plant. By age 10 or so, many children know about pregnancy. If someone explains reproduction to 10-year-olds, they usually know that a male's germ cell called the sperm combines with a female's germ cell called the egg. However, often many inaccurate ideas about reproduction continue into adolescence, which is the period of psychological and social development between childhood and adulthood.

What Do You Think?

Why might parents and other adults give incomplete or incorrect explanations to children about babies and reproduction?



The word produce means to bring forth, to make, or to create. To reproduce is to make more of the same, to make copies. Males and females together reproduce by having sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse consists of the male inserting his penis into the female's vagina (penis and vagina are the male and female sex organs). Usually the male then discharges semen, a whitish fluid that contains sperm. If one of the sperm released unites with the egg, fertilization takes place. Although sexual intercourse can occur without the release of sperm, reproduction cannot. Unlike other functions of the body (such as circulation or respiration), reproduction is not necessary to keep us alive as individuals. However, it is essential for the continuation of the human species.

The reproductive system differs from other systems of the body in another important way. Most systems of the body serve specific physiological purposes and nothing else. For example, your heart pumps blood to circulate oxygen and nutrients throughout your body. That is its only purpose. Your body depends on the heart's continuous function for survival. Although the primary purpose of the reproductive system is to produce babies, people often have sex without the intention of reproducing. Instead, they have sex to express their love for each other and for sexual enjoyment.

The reproductive system matures during puberty, the period of biological development and maturation between childhood and adulthood. In our culture, puberty happens many years before young people are psychologically and socially ready for parenthood, even though changes during puberty enable them physically to produce and bear children. What should adolescents do during this period of puberty? That is one of the sensitive questions you will consider in this unit.

What is the difference between sex and reproduction? These words are sometimes used to mean the same thing. For example, sex organs refer to the parts of the reproductive system. However, the word sex, in terms of behavior, includes more than reproduction. The only type of sexual activity that may result in reproduction is sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. Other forms of sexual activity, such as kissing or fantasy, do not result in pregnancy. So sex and reproduction do not always mean the same thing. Reproduction is only one aspect of sex.





Activity 1-1: Teaching Children about Reproduction


Introduction

It is not easy for some parents to talk to their children about reproduction. Some parents may feel embarrassed and avoid the subject. Other parents may approach the subject by explaining how reproduction is accomplished in the animal kingdom. There are those who attempt a full and complete scientific explanation accompanied by sketches of the human anatomy. Someday it may be your turn to explain the wonder of reproduction to a child. When that time comes, what will you say to your child? What would you like others to tell your child about reproduction?

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 On paper, write a few words to remind yourself how you first learned the truth about reproduction. Where were you? Who told you? What were you told? How did you feel about the experience of being told about reproduction?

Step 2 Your teacher will divide the class into small groups.

Step 3 Within each group, some students will take the part of parents and some students will take the part of teachers. As a group, discuss the following questions.

Why is it sometimes difficult for parents and teachers to speak freely and truthfully to children about the reproductive system?

How should children be taught this subject and why?

How important is it to use the correct terminology in your discussions?



Step 4 One student will facilitate the discussion in each group. One student will write down the group's conclusion. One student will present the conclusion to the class when the groups come together again for a general discussion.





What body functions serve dual purposes, one biological function and one pleasurable function? (Hint: Do you eat only because your body needs food?)





In the rest of this unit, you will learn all about reproduction. What do you already know? What questions do you hope to have answered? How comfortable will you be asking the questions you need answered? If you are not comfortable asking out loud, consider turning this assignment in to your teacher so the questions can be answered privately.





Review Questions


What is the difference between sexual intercourse and reproduction?

The distinction between reproduction and sex is important. Explain why this distinction is important to learn about, but difficult to get information on as an adolescent.





Sex Organs - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Sex Organs




How do the male and female reproductive systems work?

In this unit, we focus on the anatomy, or the structure, of the reproductive organs. For many of us, the genitalia are not “neutral” like other parts of the body, and it is often difficult to discuss them without paying attention to how we feel about them. You should be aware of your own thoughts and feelings as you read the text and look at the illustrations. Remember that your attitudes and how you express them affect others in the class.

The Male Sex Organs

The reproductive system consists of one integrated unit. The parts located outside the body are called external sex organs or genitals. The parts inside the lower abdomen are called internal sex organs. The genitals of the male include the penis, which is the male organ of sexual intercourse that the semen and urine pass through, and the scrotum, the pouch containing the testes, which are the male reproductive glands.

What Do You Think?

What are some of the reasons people in most cultures cover their genitalia even if they don't wear much other clothing?



People often associate internal sex organs with reproduction and genitals with sexual activities. This is the reason that for some people external genitals bring out many uncomfortable feelings, such as shame and embarrassment. Societies have different laws and customs about the public display of genitalia or pictures of genitalia.

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show the parts of the male reproductive system from both the side and front.



Figure 2.1 Front view of the male reproductive system.



Figure 2.2 Side view of the male reproductive system.





Activity 2-1: Male Anatomy


Introduction

Have you ever noticed how some people turn red in the face when parts of the male reproductive system are referred to by “street” slang? This can be confusing and embarrassing. In this activity you identify and label parts of the male reproductive system, using the correct scientific terminology.

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 You will be given an outlined illustration of the male reproductive system.

Step 2 See how many parts of the male reproductive system you can name and locate correctly.

Step 3 Then read the text, review your choices, and correct them if necessary.

To understand the general plan of the reproductive system, it helps to think of it as having three parts. There is the part that produces and stores the sperm. There is the part that transports the sperm. And there is the part that delivers the sperm. The ultimate biological goal of these related parts is reproduction, which is getting a sperm to combine with an egg. Everything is designed to accomplish that purpose.

The first part of the system produces sperm. Sperm are produced in the two testes. Each testis (the singular of testes ) is packed full of tiny, threadlike tubes, or tubules. Sperm cells are produced in the walls of these hollow tubules. As the sperm cells mature, they move toward the open center of the tubule. These tubules are tightly coiled to save space. If all the tubules were stretched out and connected end to end, they would measure a quarter of a mile! The testes can produce 300 million sperm each day, from puberty on.

The testes also function as endocrine glands that produce the male hormone testosterone. Testosterone is produced by cells that are located between sperm-bearing tubules. The glands are not in direct contact with sperm, but the testosterone they produce reaches sperm through the bloodstream. Testosterone is essential for the development of sperm.



Figure 2.3 Cross section of a testis.

Circumcision

All boys are born with a flap of skin, called the foreskin, covering the head, or glans, of the penis.

The foreskin can be easily pulled back to fully expose the glans. This is important to do when washing the penis, so secretions that accumulate under the foreskin are washed away.

Circumcision is a surgical procedure in which part of the foreskin is cut off. In the circumcised penis, the glans is permanently exposed.

Circumcision is an ancient practice. It existed in Egypt over 4,000 years ago. It continues to be part of the religious rituals of the Jewish faith, the Muslim faith, and other groups. In many African societies, circumcision has been part of a ceremony through which the community recognizes boys as adults.



Figure 2.4 Comparison of an uncircumcised and a circumcised penis.

In the United States, many boys are circumcised in infancy, some for religious reasons, but most for health considerations. It is easier to keep the tip of the penis clean if the foreskin has been removed. However, many doctors consider this procedure unnecessary today. Circumcision does not affect the sensitivity or function of the penis. Nor does it affect the size of the penis.

What Do You Think?

Countless magazines, videos, advertisements, and art forms display and focus on the female body and sexual characteristics. There is not nearly the same interest shown in the male body. Why do you think this is true?



The second part of the male reproductive system stores and transports sperm. Sperm cells in the tubules of each testis gradually move into a coiled storage area called the epididymis. The epididymis then becomes a single tube called the vas deferens. The vas deferens carries the sperm from the testis. The vas deferens moves away from each testis (there are two vas deferens), out of the scrotum, and into the abdomen. Each vas deferens curves over the urinary bladder and enters the prostate gland. The prostate gland is the organ at the back of the bladder that contributes the fluid to semen. Inside the prostate gland, the vas deferens joins the urethra, the tube that carries urine or semen. The urethra goes through the penis and opens to the outside. As sperm travel through the system, they combine with nutrient fluids to make up semen. These fluids come from the prostate gland and two small sacs called seminal vesicles. Semen is ejaculated from the penis during the pleasurable culmination of sexual arousal called orgasm.

In the male, the urethra carries urine from the urinary bladder (where urine is stored) to the outside of the body during urination. However, urine and semen do not mix together. The opening of the bladder closes tightly during ejaculation.



Figure 2.5 Limp and erect penes (plural of penis).

The third part of the male reproductive system is the penis, which delivers sperm to the vagina in the female. The penis is made of spongy tissue that becomes filled with blood during sexual excitement. This results in an erection when the penis becomes larger and harder and “rises” to a different angle. The erect penis enters the vagina, where it ejaculates, or discharges semen (containing sperm). An erection and ejaculation can also occur without sexual intercourse.

The fluid part of semen consists of fluid from the prostate and other glands. These secretions contain nutrients for sperm cells, and activate sperm tails so that sperm can move on their own after ejaculation in the vagina.





Why do you think an egg doesn't have a tail?





“I think what is happening to me is so wonderful, and not only what can be seen on my body, but all that is taking place inside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with anybody; that is why I have to talk to myself about them.”

- Diary of a Young Girl,

Anne Frank



Female Sex Organs

The genital organs clearly distinguish male from female. But we must not exaggerate the differences between the female and male reproductive systems. Actually, the two follow the same basic plan. Every part in the male reproductive system corresponds to a part in the female reproductive system in structure and function.

The most obvious differences between the male and female reproductive systems are the external genitalia. Unlike the male, the female sex organs lie mostly inside the abdomen. This provides protection for childbearing. The external female genitalia are less prominent and are covered by pubic hair (genital hair) following puberty.

Figure 2.6 shows the female genitalia. Two folds of skin protect the vaginal opening and the structures near it. The outer folds of skin are larger and are called the major lips (labia majora). The inner folds are narrower, free of pubic hair, and are called minor lips (labia minora).



Figure 2.6 In contrast to the male reproductive system, the female reproductive system lies almost entirely inside the abdomen.

Three structures lie in the space between the labia-the clitoris, the urethral opening (opening to the urethra), and the vagina (the passage in which intercourse takes place, leading from the uterus to the outside of the body). The clitoris is a small organ that is highly sensitive and enlarges during sexual arousal. In females, the urethra carries only urine and is independent of the reproductive system. Close to the urethral opening is the opening of the vagina that leads to the internal sex organs.

What Do You Think?

How do some people compare the importance of virginity in boys and girls?



A thin ring of tissue, called the hymen, partially covers the vaginal opening. The hymen is not found in females of other species and serves no known physiological function. Because it often tears during a woman's first act of intercourse, it has long been considered a sign of virginity-of never having had sexual intercourse. But it is possible for the hymen to become torn some other way before the first act of intercourse, and sometimes intercourse leaves it intact. Menstrual tampons do not tear the hymen.

Did You Know?

Compared to sperm, eggs are huge. Yet, the number of eggs needed to repopulate the world would equal only two gallons. A corresponding number of sperm would fit into a container the size of an aspirin tablet.



Look at Figure 2.6 to familiarize yourself with the parts and their names of the female reproductive system.

The first part of the female system stores and produces mature eggs, or ova ( ovum is singular or one egg), in the ovaries. A woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, about 400,000 in each ovary. By the time she reaches puberty, about 200,000 eggs remain. During her reproductive years, about 450 eggs mature, and only a few will ever be fertilized by (united with) a sperm.



Figure 2.7 The maturation cycle of an ova in the ovary.

Did You Know?

Fallopian tubes are about 4 inches long. They were named in the 16th century by Gabriello Fallopio who was an Italian anatomist (someone who studies bodies). He thought the Fallopian tubes were ventilators for the uterus.



Figure 2.7 shows the maturation process of an egg. An immature follicle develops into a mature follicle. The mature follicle consists of a group of cells that contain an egg surrounded by fluid. When the mature follicle ruptures, typically on day 14 of a woman's ovarian cycle, the egg is released through the ovary wall. This release of an egg is called ovulation. The now “empty” follicle is called a corpus luteum (“yellow body”). The maturing follicle produces the hormone estrogen. The corpus luteum produces progesterone. In addition, estrogen and progesterone are the hormones that help develop and maintain the female reproductive system. These hormones make pregnancy possible.

The second part of the system concerns transport of the ovum. For this function, the system of tubes in the female is much shorter than in the male. Every month at ovulation, when an ovum breaks through the ovary wall, the ovum is trapped by the fingerlike projections of the Fallopian tubes. There is one fallopian tube for each ovary. The Fallopian tube takes in the ovum and sends it towards the uterus, which is the organ in the female abdomen in which a baby develops. If the woman has had sexual intercourse within a day or so of ovulation, the egg may encounter a sperm in the Fallopian tube, and fertilization may occur. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg passes into the uterus where it becomes embedded. If no sperm are present so fertilization cannot occur, the egg disintegrates and is discarded during menstruation.

An opening in the lower part of the uterus called the cervix leads to the third part of the female reproductive system-the vagina. The vagina is where the penis delivers sperm. The vagina is also the canal through which a baby passes during birth. The vagina has soft-tissue walls and can expand to accommodate the penis during intercourse or a baby during birth.

As you can see, the female and male organs complement each other for the purpose of reproduction. It is a wonderfully designed system.





Activity 2-2: Female Anatomy


Introduction

In discussions of the human reproductive system, people often use “street” slang rather than scientific terms when talking about anatomy. To avoid possible embarrassment or confusion during classroom discussions, this activity introduces, or re-introduces, the accurate terms.

Can you name and locate the important parts of the female reproductive system correctly? This activity gives you an opportunity for you to check your knowledge.

Materials

Procedure

Step 1 You will be given an outlined illustration of the female reproductive system.

Step 2 See how many parts of the female reproductive system you can correctly name and locate.

Step 3 Then read the text, review your choices, and correct them if necessary.





Why do you think you are being taught about both male and female reproductive systems? How do you think the opposite sex feels learning about the changes that are happening to you? What did you learn that was new to you or that surprised you? Are there any questions that still haven't been answered?

Pregnancy and Childbirth - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Pregnancy and Childbirth




What happens to the mother and child during pregnancy?

Pregnancy results when a fertilized ovum implants in the wall of the uterus and continues to develop. A typical pregnancy begins with conception and ends about 296 days later with childbirth.

Did You Know?

A single act of intercourse at the time of ovulation has a 20% chance of resulting in pregnancy. Most fertile couples achieve pregnancy within six months of trying.



Fertilization occurs when a sperm unites with an egg. This typically occurs inside the ovarian end of the Fallopian tube where sperm coming from the uterus meet the egg moving towards the uterus.

There is a limited period of time during which conception may occur. The egg stays alive for 12 to 24 hours after it leaves the ovary. Sperm usually survive in the vagina for about 24 hours after ejaculation (although some may stay alive for up to three days). Therefore, for a woman to get pregnant, sexual intercourse should take place within a day before or two days after ovulation. So the total fertile period each month is up to three days.



Figure 3.1 Path of the sperm through male genitalia.



Figure 3.2 Path of sperm in the uterus and Fallopian tubes.





Fertilization Math How long might it take for a sperm to reach an egg? Use the following assumptions.

Fallopian tubes are 4 inches long.

Ovum is pushed along by cilia at the rate of 1 inch per day.

Intercourse occurs at the time that the egg leaves the follicle (ovulation).

Uterus is 3 inches long and 2 inches wide.

Sperm travel at a rate of .08 inches per minute.





Activity 3-1: The Journey of the Sperm and the Egg


Introduction

You are an editor for a scientific journal. An author was asked to write an essay describing the journey of the sperm and egg. However, the author never learned the correct scientific terminology, so the essay is incomplete. It is your job to complete this essay using the correct terminology.

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 You will receive an activity sheet showing both the male and female reproductive systems.

Step 2 Follow the instructions on the activity sheet.

Did You Know?

Sperm contain three parts-head, middle, and tail. The head contains all of the genetic material. The middle part has the energy pack that propels the tail that moves the sperm.





Figure 3.3 The journey of a fertilized egg from the Fallopian tube to the uterus takes about one week.

Journey of the Fertilized Egg

As shown in Figure 3.3, the fertilized egg gradually moves through the Fallopian tube toward the uterus. While on its way, the fertilized egg begins to divide, first into two cells, then into four cells, then eight cells, and so on. By the end of a week, when it reaches the entrance to the uterus, it has become a cluster of cells that implants or lodges in the uterine wall called the endometrium. The cluster of cells is now a growing organism called an embryo. It will be called an embryo for the first eight weeks of intrauterine development. After eight weeks, the embryo is called a fetus. We will explore the development of the fetus in the next section. In this section you will discuss pregnancy as an expectant mother experiences it.





If sperm moving up the uterus to the Fallopian tubes don't know which tube has an egg in it, what percent chance does each sperm have of choosing the right tube?





Did You Know?

Pregnancy tests recognize special chemicals called hormones that are produced during pregnancy. The implanted embryo provides one such hormone. Sometimes these hormones are present in abnormal conditions. However, this hormone normally occurs only in pregnancy. So if this hormone appears in a healthy woman's urine or blood, it is chemical evidence that she is pregnant.



How does a woman know if she is pregnant? The most commonly noticed sign is a missed menstrual period. Since menstrual periods are not always regular, a period may be late by several days or even longer for reasons other than pregnancy. Malnutrition, stress, or long periods of strenuous exercise may cause a late or missed period. Nevertheless, if a woman has had sexual intercourse, and her period is a week or more late, she should take a pregnancy test, either with a home kit or at a doctor's office. If a pregnancy kit is used at home and shows she is pregnant, the woman should begin seeing a doctor.



Figure 3.4 This picture shows what an ultrasound picture of a fetus looks like.

During the first couple of months, a pregnant woman is likely to feel unusually tired. She may experience nausea and vomiting. Since these symptoms are worse in the morning, they are called “morning sickness.” Her breasts may feel swollen and she may need to urinate frequently. By the third or fourth month, her abdomen will begin to swell, and she may feel the fetus move. Most women look forward to hearing the baby's heartbeat, which is usually audible with a special stethoscope by the third or fourth month. Some women also have an opportunity to see their baby through an image generated by an ultrasound machine that uses sound waves to show a picture of the baby on a television monitor (Figure 3.4). Ultrasound is a useful tool in detecting problems with the developing fetus. It also offers parents their first view of the baby. Ultrasound is much safer than X rays.

By the end of the first trimester, or the first three months, the mother is typically free of the symptoms of early pregnancy. Hence, the next three months are usually a more comfortable time. They are also an exciting time as the mother starts to feel the fetus moving. Women can continue working and taking part in gentle exercise like swimming and walking throughout the second trimester quite comfortably. Some women exercise up to the day their babies are born.

Did You Know?

Among mammals, the opossum has the shortest pregnancy (gestation period) of 14-17 days. The Asian elephant endures the longest pregnancy-645 days!



The third trimester may involve a bit more discomfort as the fetus increases in size. A pregnant woman typically gains a total of 20 to 30 pounds. Of that 20 to 30 pounds, only about 7 to 8 pounds is due to the developing baby. Women who gain excessive weight may experience complications. By the third trimester, a woman often begins feeling impatient and starts to prepare herself for the baby's arrival.

Pregnancy usually progresses normally, but it can have complications that may endanger the mother or the baby. In earlier times, pregnancy and childbirth often caused illness and death. At present, one in 10,000 pregnant women in the United States dies as a result of pregnancy. This average figure is called the maternal mortality rate. The maternal mortality rate varies widely in different groups. Pregnant women who receive good medical care, called prenatal care, early in their pregnancy have a much lower risk of complications than those who do not receive medical care. Good medical care encourages healthy eating habits, exercise, and the avoidance of drugs and alcohol. In addition, women receive lots of information about themselves and their baby, which prepares them for motherhood.

Pregnant adolescents are generally less likely to receive good care, especially if they are poor. Many pregnant teenage girls fear and deny being pregnant. They often do not see a physician until there is a problem. Prenatal care is expensive, and those without insurance coverage to help pay for office visits don't go. Also, some adolescent girls who get pregnant engage in high-risk behavior (besides having unprotected sexual intercourse, which always carries the risk of pregnancy) such as drinking alcohol or taking drugs. Since drugs and alcohol can cause a number of complications for the baby before and after birth, it is even more important than usual to avoid drugs and alcohol during pregnancy. Prenatal care can make a big difference. Prenatal care educates an expectant mother about, and often helps her to change, any behaviors that may be harmful to her and her baby.

If a woman suspects she is pregnant, she should see a doctor as soon as possible to confirm the pregnancy and to begin receiving the guidance and care that is necessary to safeguard her health and the health of her developing baby.

In addition to laboratory tests, a woman can use a pregnancy-testing kit available at drugstores for home use. These tests can detect pregnancies as early as nine days after a missed period. If a test is repeated a week later, the results are accurate about 90% of the time.





Embryonic Models Using paper, clay, string, or any materials you think will work, construct life-size models of the embryo/fetus at various stages of development.





The Development and Birth of the Baby

Now let's turn to the development of the baby. At the time of implantation, the embryo is no larger than a tiny dot, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. However, at implantation the embryo is more than just a jumble of cells. By the third week of life, its cells have organized into three layers. The parts and systems of the body grow out of these three layers. At one month, the embryo is no bigger than the nail of your finger, yet it already has a tiny heart, a growing brain, and the beginnings of eyes and ears (Figure 3.5). The sex of the embryo, however, is not yet apparent from the genitals. By the end of eight weeks, all of the essential organs are in place but will continue to grow and mature.

Fetal Development during the First Three Months (First Trimester)

During first month

Heart starts beating.

Blood begins to circulate.

Brain begins to form.

The eyes and ears begin to form.



During second month

Arms, legs, and internal organs take shape.

All organs are in place.

Basic human form begins to appear.



During third month

Male and female genitalia look different.

Fingers, toes, and nails form.

Sense organs develop.





Figure 3.5 Embryonic development during the first three months.

From eight weeks on, the development of the fetus is mainly a matter of further growth in size and maturation in function. No new parts develop-everything is already in place. At three months, the fetus is still small enough to fit in an adult's hand, but it can swallow and bend its fingers. By four months, all of the major organs are well formed and the fetus looks like a tiny baby (Figure 3.6).

The fetus grows in a sac full of fluid, called amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid provides extra protection against physical injury. The fetus depends completely on the mother for sustenance. The umbilical cord is the fetus's lifeline to the mother. It connects the circulatory system of the fetus to that of the mother through the placenta.

The placenta grows from fetal and maternal tissues into an organ that weighs about one pound. It is lodged in the wall of the uterus at the site of implantation. Within the placenta, oxygen and nutrients in maternal blood pass into fetal blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide and waste products in fetal blood pass into the maternal blood and are carried away.



Figure 3.6 Fetus at 19 weeks, 8 inches (actual size).

The exchange of wastes and nutrients between maternal and fetal blood takes place through the walls of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Maternal and fetal blood do not come in direct contact or mix with each other. Body functions normally performed by breathing, digesting foods, and getting rid of wastes are carried out for the fetus by the mother's body.

Fetal Development during the Second Three Months (Second Trimester)

During fourth month

Muscles move.

Facial features form, including eyebrows and eyelashes.

Reacts to sounds.

Hair covers body.



During fifth month

Fetal movement can be felt by mother.

Heartbeat can be heard.



During sixth month

Brain waves begin.

Eyes open.

Fingerprints and footprints form.



Fetal Development during the last Three Months (Third Trimester)

During seventh month

Adds body fat.

Moves around a lot.

Experiences periods of being awake and asleep.



During eighth month

Grows taller and heavier.

Nails and bones begin to harden.



During ninth month

Organs mature.

Can best survive outside uterus.





Figure 3.7 A baby at full term.

What Do You Think?

Why might some people prefer to give birth in their own home with a midwife attending, instead of giving birth in a hospital?



It takes about nine months for the human fetus to become fully mature (Figure 3.7). Babies born before eight months are usually considered premature. Prematurity is not only a question of time, but also a matter of weight. Babies usually weigh a little over 7 pounds, but they can be quite a bit heavier or lighter. Do you know how much you weighed at birth? A baby who weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2,500 grams) is considered premature. Most premature babies can survive only with special medical care. But the limit for viability, the ability to survive outside the mother's body, is about six months, which is at the end of the second trimester. Fetuses usually weigh about 2.2 pounds at this time.





Why do you have a belly button or a navel?





Childbirth

Toward the end of the seventh month, most babies are in an “upside-down” position with their heads pointing towards the cervix (see Figure 3.7). As the time of childbirth approaches, the mother begins to experience occasional contractions of her uterus. When these contractions become strong and regular, the mother has entered labor, the process of bringing the fetus from inside the uterus out into the world. With each contraction, the uterine muscles push the fetus down, the lower part of the uterus, opening the cervix to let the baby through (Figure 3.8).



Figure 3.8 Steps in a normal birth.

What Do You Think?

Can you control what sex child you have?



Soon after birth, the baby's lungs expand, and it is no longer dependent on the placenta for oxygen and nutrients. A new person has now joined the world.





Why is it even more important than usual for a woman to not smoke, drink, or use drugs when she is or may become pregnant? Why are the first three months of pregnancy so critical?

Why are most babies in an “upside-down” position in the uterus? Why is it easier for a baby to be born headfirst?

How do twins occur?





Activity 3-2: Boy or Girl?


Introduction

Throughout history, it was a common misconception that women somehow determined the sex of the child. For example, Henry VIII (king of England in the 16th century) blamed his wives for not producing a male heir. He divorced two wives and even beheaded two. Perhaps if King Henry did the following activity, he would have been a more understanding husband!

All eggs contain an X chromosome. A sperm can contain either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. When the egg and the sperm unite, the sex of the child is determined by the X and Y chromosomes present. If there are two X chromosomes, the child will be a girl. If there is an X chromosome and a Y chromosome, the child will be a boy. Since all eggs contribute an X chromosome, the sex of the child is actually determined by the father's sperm, which can contain either an X or a Y chromosome.

Becoming a Parent




Why is becoming a parent so important?

Becoming a parent can be a joyful experience. Watching and helping a child grow into maturity is wonderful. However, enjoying parenthood requires that you become a parent at the right time, with the right person, and for the right reasons. Becoming a parent before being physically, socially, emotionally, and economically ready can be very difficult. Moreover, not everyone wants to, can, or perhaps should become a parent.

“In China, the oldest starts cooking at five; you change diapers at six.”

-Debbie, 13, Chinese New Kids on the Block

Why Adults Have Children

Throughout much of history, women and men became parents as early as physically possible. Until modern tunes, girls became mothers soon after puberty and still do so in some parts of the world. For example, in some parts of the developing world, girls acquire adult status much earlier than they do in the United States. Where our society would consider young teens to be adolescents, other girls are full-fledged adults according to their society's standards. At young ages (13 or 14), they take on adult responsibilities and privileges, although most get little schooling.

Adolescents in industrialized societies such as the United States have very different experiences than adolescents in many other societies. Socially, financially, and educationally, most men and women are not ready for parenthood until they are in their 20s or even later if they want to pursue careers.

This does not mean that American teenagers do not become pregnant. As a matter of fact, nearly one million American teenagers become pregnant each year. Most teenage pregnancies are unplanned, often unwanted, and ill advised. Why, then, do so many teenagers become parents each year? This question is one we will consider throughout the unit.





Activity 4-1: Why Have Children?


Introduction

One major life decision a person makes is whether or not to have children. It is wise to consider the reasons for becoming a parent before the pregnancy occurs.

Materials

Procedure

Step 1 List five reasons why you believe people choose to have children. Then list five things that you think all potential parents should know and be able to do before they have children in order to ensure that the children will be well taken care of.

Step 2 Your teacher will divide the class into small groups. Each group will select a discussion leader and a reporter.

Step 3 The reporter will list the responses of the group on the Activity Report and use this sheet when reporting back to the class.

Changes in the American Family

There are many reasons people want to have children. Many adults want children for psychological and social reasons. Parents want to give and receive love. They want to experience the joys of raising children. Some people feel a family is not complete without children, and that children may be the bond between couples. Sometimes couples feel pressure from their own parents to produce grandchildren.

Reasons for having children have changed throughout history. In the past, economic pressures motivated couples to have children. For example, there used to be many family-run farms in which family members did much of the work, and every child meant another pair of working hands. The same considerations applied to urban families who relied on family members to work in factories. About 100 years ago, there was no required schooling, nor were there laws against child labor. Children often worked full-time jobs or took care of the house and younger brothers and sisters as soon as they were able. Many children still help their parents, but fewer parents depend on such support. In fact, the level of education necessary to get good jobs in this society has lengthened the period of adolescence. Today, many parents cannot afford to support a large family since many teens don't work until they graduate from high school or college.

Couples today also have fewer children and have them later in their marriages than couples did in the past. Also, many couples wait longer to have children today, leaving less time in their reproductive years to get pregnant. This factor often results in smaller families. In 1964, the average age of the first marriage for women was about 21 years. For men the average age for their first marriage was 24 years. Currently, the average age for women to marry the first time is about 25. The average age for men's first marriages is about 27. Among college graduates, many men and women are getting married for the first time in their late 20s, 30s, and even 40s.

During the past 200 years, the fertility rate, the number of children born to a couple in our society, has gradually declined. In other words, today's families have fewer children. There are several reasons for this decline in fertility rate. At one time in history, health care was poor and many infants died. So some couples had many children to ensure that several would survive. Today, health care is vastly improved and infant survival rates are higher. Another reason for the decline in fertility rate is the increased use of contraception (methods for preventing pregnancy). After the 1960s, the greater availability of contraception provided couples greater control over reproduction.

What Do You Think?

Do you think members of your generation will marry at younger or older ages than present trends (about 25 years for women and about 27 for men)? Will men and women differ in this respect? Would you like to have many children, a few children, or no children?



Two other important trends characterize families today. First, divorce and remarriage rates have increased dramatically over the last 30 years. Today, many children have parents and stepparents. Also, as a result of divorce, single-parent families, usually consisting of a mother and children, are much more common. Today, over 25% of children live in single-family homes. This is compared to less than 11% in 1970. The traditional family-consisting of father, mother, and their biological children-counts for only one out of four American households.

Adopting Children

So far, we have focused on men and women having their own children, but about 10% of the reproductive age population are infertile. Either due to a medical problem in the woman or the man or in both, infertile couples cannot have children.

What Do You Think?

Would you adopt a child? Would you adopt instead of having your own biological child if you were fertile? Would you adopt a child from another country?



Some couples adopt children. They become legal parents of a child whose biological parents (the individuals who physically conceived and delivered the child) cannot or choose not to keep the child. Some couples adopt children in addition to having their own biological children. Experiencing parenthood through adoption differs little from raising biological children when it comes to love and commitment.

Several other options exist for childless couples. One is artificial insemination, which is the injection of semen into the vagina or uterus by a method other than sexual intercourse in order to cause pregnancy. If the male is sterile (produces no sperm or sperm that cannot fertilize an egg), a woman can use another man's sperm to become pregnant. In this situation, usually a donor produces sperm through masturbation. The sperm is frozen for storage. Later, after the sperm has been selected, a doctor deposits the selected sperm in the woman's vagina. If the sperm fertilizes an egg, pregnancy will occur just as it would as a result of sexual intercourse.

Did You Know?

The first baby born as a result of in vitro fertilization was born in England in 1978. Since then, over 10,000 babies have been born in the United States alone as a result of this medical technology.



Other couples try in vitro fertilization. This procedure involves fertilizing the mother's eggs (or a donor's eggs) with the father's sperm (or a donor's sperm) outside the body in a special dish. (In vitro fertilization does not take place in a test tube, even though the term “test-tube baby” is often used.) The fertilized eggs are then transferred to the woman's uterus with the hope that at least one fertilized egg will survive.

Contracting with a surrogate mother is another way infertile couples can have children. A surrogate mother is a woman who carries and gives birth to a child for other people. The child carried by the surrogate mother might have some or none of the parents' genetic material. Contracting with a surrogate mother is not a common way for people to have children.





New Terms in Reproduction

Define the following:

sperm bank

embryo transfer

microinjection



How do these terms relate to the discussion of childless couples?





These medical interventions allow many couples who otherwise wouldn't be able to experience parenthood to become parents. These medical interventions are also expensive, as well as physically and emotionally demanding, paths to take.





Activity 4-2: Newborn

Adolescent Pregnancy - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Adolescent Pregnancy




What are some of the physical, emotional, and social effects of becoming a teenage parent?

Biologically, adolescent girls can become pregnant just as adult women can. However, younger adolescent mothers and their children tend to experience greater risks, often due to poor prenatal care. Even though there is little difference biologically, there are enormous differences in psychological and social terms between having a child at 15, while still in high school, and at age 25. Generally, the younger the teenage mother, the more serious the problems and disruptions will be to her life. About 12,000 girls 14 years old and younger become pregnant each year. These adolescents are especially at risk. On the other hand, some 18- or 19-year-olds who become pregnant are capable of being competent mothers.

Abstinence is the refraining from sexual intercourse altogether. Abstinence is the safest choice for adolescents. If you abstain from sex, you will never get pregnant or you will not get someone else pregnant. Most adolescents who engage in sexual intercourse that leads to pregnancy are neither ready nor interested in becoming parents. So why do they take the chance? What is the likelihood that a sexually active adolescent will become pregnant?

As shown in Figure 5.1, among young American women aged 15 to 19, about half are sexually active, or engage in sexual intercourse; the other half are not sexually active.



Figure 5.1 Sexual activity among women ages 15-19.





Teenage Pregnancy Rates-A Little Math Work Convert data in Figure 5.1 to

numbers (e.g., of the 9 million women, how many engage in sex, use contraception, etc.),

a bar graph using numbers or percents,

ratios, and

rates per thousand.





About two thirds of those adolescents who are sexually active use contraception. The other third do not. 20% of sexually active girls become pregnant. A sexually active girl who does not use contraception has a 90% chance of pregancy within one year. However, some sexually active girls who use contraception become pregnant, also. How can this happen?

Pregnancy can occur if the contraceptive is not used correctly, or because most methods of contraception are not foolproof. Unlike contraception, abstinence is foolproof. If you abstain from sex, you will never get pregnant. Engaging in sexual intercourse can result in unwanted pregnancy. Using effective contraceptives can greatly reduce, but does not entirely eliminate, the chances of pregnancy.

What Do You Think?

Since it is so hard for adolescents to raise a child, why do you think many more of them don't give up their babies for adoption?



About 32% of the girls who become pregnant have abortions (termination of pregnancy) and another 14% miscarry. About half of the girls who become pregnant give birth to their babies. The majority of those girls who give birth keep their babies. However, some offer their babies for adoption.

The facts on teenage pregnancy listed below provide more information on this very serious problem.

Teenage Pregnancy Facts

During the past 10 years, over 10 million adolescents got pregnant. This number represents about 1 in 10 female adolescents.

Each year approximately 500,000 children are born to adolescent mothers. 85% of these babies are unplanned.

About 10,000 babies are born every year to children under age 15.

One-fourth of teenage mothers have a second child within two years of their first.

A sexually active girl who does not use contraception has a 90% chance of pregnancy within one year.

Of teenage mothers aged 15 or younger, 82% were themselves daughters of teenage mothers.

Teenage pregnancy rates have changed over time in this country. For example, the number of teenage pregnancies was much lower in the United States during the 1950s. Teenage pregnancies increased sharply in the 1960s and 1970s during the “sexual revolution.”

In poorer communities, teenage pregnancy rates are twice as high as the average. Education and financial status are good predictors of teenage pregnancy-the lower the level of education and the lower the financial status, the more likely a teen will get pregnant.

Teenage pregnancy rates in the United States are much higher than in European countries. For example, U.S. rates are twice as high as England or Canada and nine times as high as the Netherlands or Japan.

-Robin, Flour Babies

Anne Fine



Did You Know?

The sexual revolution of the 1960-70s reflected a cultural revolution of young people in this country. Adolescents, especially older adolescents, demonstrated a lot of antisocial behavior. Long hair, baggy and tattered clothes, drugs, alcohol, and a permissive attitude toward sex prevailed. Among young women, the number engaging in premarital sex increased dramatically.



What Do You Think?

Why do you think children of adolescent mothers have a greater chance of becoming teenage mothers themselves? What could prevent this from happening?





Activity 5-1: Why Do Adolescents Become Pregnant?


Introduction

For many adolescents, pleas or pressure from a sexual partner overshadow concerns about the possibility of pregnancy. How many times have lines such as these been thought of or spoken during sexual arousal?

“It can't happen to me.”

“You won't get pregnant the first time.”

“C'mon, just one time won't make any difference.”

“Don't worry. I can't get pregnant at this time of the month.”

“If you really loved me, you wouldn't stop me now!”

“But we're engaged.”

And how many times have such statements led to a decision that changed someone's life forever?

Over a million teenagers become pregnant each year. Most of these pregnancies are unwanted. Have you ever wondered why so many adolescents are willing to risk pregnancy and all the responsibilities pregnancy brings with it? This activity examines some of the reasons given.

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 You will be given an Activity Report requiring your written response to several questions. This should take about 10 minutes.

Step 2 Your teacher will then divide the class into groups.

Step 3 Take your Activity Report with you. In your groups, compare your responses with those of the other members of your group.

Step 4 After the discussion, write your own personal position statement on adolescent pregnancy.

What Do You Think?

Why is there such a sharp difference between teenage pregnancy rates in this country and those in other industrialized countries?



The Psychology of Adolescent Pregnancy

Earlier we explored some basic reasons that adult couples have children. Some of those same reasons may apply to adolescents. But adolescents often have their own special reasons for wanting to have children.

One reason adolescents give for having a child is to show that they are “grown up.” Also, some adolescent boys may assume that fathering a child is a way to gain respect. Other adolescents feel that becoming a parent is a way to bolster their self-esteem. Some adolescents say they are looking for love and affection they don't get from their families. Some adolescents admit that they see getting pregnant as a way to rebel-a way of “getting even” with or punishing parents. By getting pregnant, a girl may avoid going to school. It may be a remedy against boredom or a way of getting welfare payments from the state. None of these reasons are positive reasons for getting pregnant.

What Do You Think?

What would you say to an adolescent who is thinking about getting pregnant because she wants to become an “adult” quickly?





Role-play Becoming a Parent Work with a partner to explore issues in teenage pregnancy. One of you is a teenager looking to parenthood as a way to get respect and to be treated like a grown-up. The other is a school counselor trying to convince the teenager that parenthood is not the answer. After 10 minutes, trade roles and trade partners. Share your findings with the class.





There are, of course, much better ways of improving and maintaining self-esteem, attaining adulthood status, or gaining respect, such as finishing school, getting a job, or pursuing a career. Adolescents who use pregnancy in the ways listed above may not be fully aware of what they are doing. The price they pay is very high for themselves and for the child they bring into the world.

Many sexually active teenagers get pregnant because they do not know about contraception or cannot get contraception. But others do not even try to obtain contraceptive methods because they think pregnancy cannot happen to them. Still others are ignorant of the simple facts of how or when pregnancy occurs. Additionally, those who abuse alcohol or drugs are more likely to take greater risks with their own sexual behavior.

Effects of Adolescent Pregnancy

The impact of adolescent pregnancy is mainly on the mother and child. However, the father, parents, and society as a whole are also affected and must help bear the impact.

Did You Know?

An average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is $153,660. That does not include the cost of college.



Being a teenage parent creates difficult choices and challenges. Basically, these choices and challenges fall into three categories-biological, psychological, and social. How well anyone handles these challenges depends largely on his or her social circumstances and maturity. The poorer and more socially disadvantaged the person, the rougher it is. The younger (or less mature) the teen, the more difficult the challenge will be.

With good prenatal care, pregnancy presents few problems to girls who are 18 years old and older. By that age, a girl is biologically fit to be a mother. A girl younger than 14 or one who has not fully developed faces the physical burden of sustaining not only her own growing body, but also the growing body of a fetus. Typically the mother, the fetus, or both will suffer.

Did You Know?

Lack of prenatal care contributes to special health hazards, such as having four to five times as many complications during pregnancy as women who receive prenatal care.



Socially, becoming a parent is not a one-time event (unless the child is put up for adoption). Raising a child requires time, love, and money. How do you get a good job without education? In this highly technological society, education is critical. How do you get an education if you have a baby to care for at home? How do you get a baby-sitter without any money? For many young mothers, pregnancy creates a cycle of dependency, a cycle of relying on others such as family or government funds for support. Once a cycle of dependency is established, it is difficult to get out of it. Also, being a parent puts a lot of restrictions on how a person spends his or her time. Parenting can be a very lonely experience, so many teenage parents feel socially isolated. They are not treated with respect by most adults, and they no longer feel a part of their peer group (people who are the same age or in the same grade). They are teenagers who must learn to cope in an adult world.

Babies of Teenage Mothers

Prenatal care is important at any age, but it is especially important for young mothers. Many adolescent mothers are not physiologically mature. That is, they are not fully developed physically. Also, many adolescent mothers have poor health habits, such as unhealthy diets, smoking, or drug and alcohol use. The lack of prenatal care makes it more likely that babies born to teenage mothers will have more problems than those born to women in their 20s and 30s. Prenatal care detects health problems before they become serious. It teaches the mother, no matter what age, that what she eats and what she does directly impacts the baby. Prenatal care encourages the mother to develop healthy habits and eliminate unhealthy ones. It helps her understand her feelings and learn what to expect. Without prenatal care, problems increase.

Premature and Low Birth Weight

Infants born early or weighing less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2,500 grams) at birth are at greater risk of dying during the first year. They are also more likely to suffer long-term disabilities such as learning disabilities, brain disorders, and behavioral disturbances. These problems put an even greater burden on the young mothers taking care of these children.

Did You Know?

One-third of pregnant teenagers receive inadequate prenatal care.



About 10% of infants born in the United States are premature. With proper care, most of them develop normally. Many factors can cause prematurity. Teenage mothers (as well as those who are 40 or older) are more likely to have premature infants. Because adolescents who use drugs or alcohol are more likely to be sexually active, teenage mothers are often drug or alcohol users. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs are unhealthy activities anytime. During pregnancy, smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs are harmful to both the mother and the fetus. These activities increase the chances of premature birth and health problems in the baby.

Birth Defects

Some infants are born with a malformed body part or body function. These malformations or birth defects develop while the fetus is in the uterus rather than after birth. However, some birth defects may not be apparent right away. Some may surface later on as the baby grows.

Birth defects may be cause d by genetic factors from the mother or from the father, or they may result from harmful influences during pregnancy. These influences can include illness or diseases suffered by the mother or exposure of the fetus to harmful substances such as tobacco, drugs, or alcohol.





Teen Parents Looking for a Job Explore the problems of getting a job as a pregnant teen or young mother with a baby. Working in pairs, one of you should role-play them other interviewing for a job and the other should role-play the interviewer. What concerns might the interviewer have? After 10 minutes, trade roles and trade partners. Share your answers with the group.





Many birth defects are minor or easily treated. Some 2% of defects seriously impact normal growth or functions. Any mother can give birth to an infant with birth defects, but the likelihood is greater for teenage mothers. The higher risk of defects often results from life circumstances, such as poor nutrition or an unhealthy environment, or the lack of prenatal care. The combination of these factors and a young age can add up to the fact that a teenage mother is more likely to have a baby who will be sick or die within the first year.

Premature babies with inadequate care are more likely to grow up in poverty, do poorly in school, and be abused or neglected. This is not to say all teenage mothers are incapable of caring for their infants. There are certainly some who prove to be excellent mothers, especially with help from their families or public institutions. But even then, the personal cost to the teenage parent, especially the mother, is enormous.

Difficult Feelings

Health problems, while important, are by no means the only or most important issues related to teenage pregnancy. From a practical standpoint, being pregnant, or being the sexual partner of someone who is pregnant, has a tremendous impact on one's life. It influences feelings, behavior, success at school, future plans, and relationships with parents and friends. Pregnancy affects every option in life. Psychologically a teenager can be overwhelmed by the responsibilities of parenthood depending on the individual's level of maturity, family support, and financial support. In this society, which emphasizes individualism and independence, children are not in a good position to bring up their own children.





Activity 5-2: Problems of Being a Mother and Father


Introduction

Imagine this scenario: It's Saturday night, and a teenage couple is watching a video in his parents' house. They sit together on the couch, holding hands. She turns to him and says, “Um, honey, I'm pregnant.” What happens next? The reaction could range from “My dreams have come true!” to “A-I-E-E-E-E-E!” But now the fact remains that she's pregnant, and the problems of pregnancy begin. Do you have any idea what these problems could be?

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 You will be given an Activity Report requesting your written response to the question: “What specific problems could a mother face? A father face?”

Step 2 Your teacher will then divide the class into groups.

Step 3 You will compare your responses with those in your group.

Step 4 The group will then tally the responses and report back to the class.

Step 5 Write a position statement expressing your views about becoming a teenage mother or father.

Many confusing and conflicting emotions surface when a teenage woman and her sexual partner suspect or realize that she may be pregnant. The initial reaction is often one of disbelief (“This can't be happening to me.”). Denial of the unpleasant reality sometimes leads a pregnant teenager to delay getting help for weeks or even months, until the signs of her pregnancy become obvious.

Other likely feelings include fear (“What is going to happen to me?”), shame (“What will everyone say?”), guilt (“I will be punished.”), and often regret (“I shouldn't have done it.”). Anger at the partner (“How could you do this to me?”) is especially severe if seduction, pressure, coercion, or any kind of force led to the pregnancy. However, not all reactions to pregnancy are negative. As discussed in the previous section, some adolescents get pregnant because they want to. Or a pregnancy may be unintended, but the parents may be pleased or able to make the best of the situation at least. In those cases, it is more likely there will be feelings of excitement, pride, and anticipation. Many feelings depend on the life circumstances of the people involved, including how much support and counseling they receive.

Hard Choices

The pregnant teenager and her partner face some tough choices. Once again, the situation is not the same for everyone. Age, family background, religious beliefs, future goals, and financial factors will significantly influence the choices that are available. The pregnant teenager must decide first if she will have the baby. About half of teenage mothers decide to carry on with the pregnancy. Of those, most decide to keep and raise the baby and a small fraction decide to offer the baby for adoption. The other choice a pregnant teenager has is abortion, or the termination of the pregnancy. The decisions a pregnant teenager must make involve many emotional, physical, psychological, and moral considerations. And if she decides to carry on with the pregnancy and raise the baby herself, there are many practical consequences that will affect her day-to-day life and her future plans.

Most adolescents are far from being socially or financially independent. This fact results in many problems trying to raise a child. Often, a pregnant teenager drops out of school, or girls with poor academic skills and performance are more likely to get pregnant after dropping out of school. Seven out of ten teenagers who become pregnant finish high school, but they are less likely to go on to college than women who delay childbirth.

A teen mother does not have as many choices as other teens when it comes to time or activities. A teen mother often feels isolated and lonely. Achieving her aspirations or dreams of a career may seem impossible. This is especially true if the teen mother comes from a disadvantaged background. An adolescent mother will more likely depend on welfare support to care for herself and her child. About 55% of women on welfare became mothers during adolescence.

What Do You Think?

If you were the principal of a high school, would you allow or encourage a pregnant teenager to continue attending classes as long as possible? What are your arguments for and against her doing so?



A young father also faces difficult life choices. He, too, is likely to drop out of school, especially if he wants to help support his child. Without a good education, many young fathers will remain in low-paying jobs. Adolescent fathers also commonly feel left out and powerless because their female partners make the key choices and confront the consequences. Many of these young fathers are prevented from seeing their children if they separate from the child's mother. Their self-esteem suffers from the inability to support their children and the negative view that society typically has of teen parents.

Traditionally, getting married has been the “solution” to the problem of premarital pregnancy. If the couple is compatible and mature enough, this may be a successful relationship. However, teenage marriages tend to break up at a much higher rate than later marriages. It takes more than having a child to make a marriage work.

In some cultures and in some families, teenage pregnancy is not as serious a problem as in others. In some cultural or family situations, the older women may take on the burden of care, adding the new baby to the extended family. However, although these families survive, they are usually financially dependent on others such as the government. In these situations, it becomes hard for an individual to break free from that cycle of poverty.





Look at the Did You Know? on page 31. Calculate the monthly cost of raising two children. If you are a parent on welfare receiving the 1990 average monthly payment, is your welfare check enough to cover the cost of caring for your children?





What Do You Think?

Do you think welfare encourages a cycle of dependency? Should people in need receive help from the government? If so, for how long should they receive it? Would you put restrictions or conditions on those payments (such as finding a job within six months)?





Looking at Welfare Payments Using the numbers from Figure 5.3, calculate the following:

Total payments made to families in 1950

Total payments made to families in 1990

Percentage change in average monthly payments from 1950 to 1970 to 1990

Percentage increase in the number of recipients from 1950 to 1990

Percentage change in total payments from 1950 to 1990

Family Planning and Abstinence - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Family Planning and Abstinence




How does someone decide when and if to have children?

Responsible and rewarding parenthood requires an enormous commitment. It calls for taking on serious responsibility for the lives of others. It calls for huge investments of thought, emotion, time, money, and effort. So it stands to reason that only when we truly want children and can adequately care for them should we become parents.

Despite the many burdens of parenthood, the great majority of Americans sooner or later become parents-over 90% have or adopt children. So the question for most of us is not whether or not to have children, but when.

Taking active steps to determine when to have children and how many to have requires effective family planning. In deciding when to become a parent or determining the number of children to have, an individual or couple can rely on two approaches. Abstinence is the safest and most certain choice for avoiding unwanted pregnancy. A second approach of using contraceptives is riskier. Using methods of contraception to reduce the chances of pregnancy relies on various methods of preventing pregnancy, some of which are more effective than others. However, none are as effective as abstinence.

Why Some People Choose Not to Have Children

Since teenage pregnancy creates so many problems, it is no wonder that the majority of adolescents do not get pregnant. In our concern over the high rate of adolescent pregnancy, we should not lose sight of the fact that most adolescents do not get pregnant. Having focused so far on why people have children, let us now turn to the opposite issue. Let's explore some of the reasons both adolescents and adults give for not having children.



Figure 6.1 Growth in the world population has skyrocketed in the last 100 years.

Most people who are not married or who are not in a stable relationship do not want children. The responsibilities and obligations of parenthood keep most couples from having children until they are surer of their relationship and more comfortable in their financial security. Some couples postpone having children for career reasons. Women, especially, may not be ready to interrupt career development with pregnancy and child rearing. Other couples simply cannot afford to have a child without lowering their standard of living.

Some couples do not want children at any time. They would rather spend their time, money, and energies on other things. Some do not want to bring children into a world that seems to have so much wrong with it. Others choose not to become parents as part of their religious vows.

Did You Know?

Currently, the world population grows by about 81 million people each year. By 2010, it is projected that the world population will grow by about 68 million each year.

The world population growth rate from 1990- 2000 increased 1.4% each year. The projected growth rate for the years 2010-2020 is 1%. If the growth rate is declining, why does the population continue to grow?





Population Control

The single most important societal, rather than personal, reason for not having children is that there are already too many people in the world. Over population is a world situation in which the number of people in the world is more than the available resources can successfully support. Thomas Malthus, an English economist and clergyman, addressed the problem of overpopulation back in the 19th century. He observed that the population growth was doubling while the food supply increased more slowly. As a result of his observations, he predicted that the population of the world would sooner or later run out of food and starve.

Figure 6.1 shows that at least part of Malthus's prediction has come true. You will note that the population of the world grew very slowly until about 100 years ago. Since then it has skyrocketed. More than 6 billion people now live on Earth.

What Do You Think?

Why is overpopulation more likely in poorer countries? And why does it, in turn, keep them poor?



However, with respect to food availability, production has grown faster than Malthus predicted. Mass starvation has been avoided worldwide, but in some areas of the world periodic famine kills hundreds of thousands of people. Tragically, the poorest countries often have the fastest growing populations, which is one of the reasons they remain poor. For example, the population of the United States will double in 70 years, but the population of Pakistan will double in 28 years (if current rates of growth continue).

Malthus did not predict another serious consequence of over population. Over population causes environmental degradation, which is the breakdown of the environment. This problem involves how many people there are and how much of Earth's resources they use. In this respect, industrialized countries such as the United States harm the environment much more than less developed countries. Industrialized countries consume a far greater share of natural resources (such as oil) per person, and they pollute the environment more through their industries and their products (such as cars) than do other less industrialized countries.

What Do You Think?

Explain the statement “Children are both a blessing and a burden.”



In the United States, the birthrate (especially among adolescents) is higher among the poorer sections of society than among the more affluent. The younger the women with children, the greater the burden that is added to the population. Why is this true? The more children the poor have, the poorer they are likely to remain. However, the wealthier segments of society add more to the environmental burden through their excessive use of resources. So to solve the population and environment crisis, all of us need to change our behavior in important ways.





According to Figure 6.1, the world population remained at fairly constant levels for hundreds of years before it suddenly exploded. What happened? What two elements had to change for the population to increase so dramatically?





What Do You Think?

Explore the issue of population growth from a quantitative perspective (how many people there are) and from a qualitative perspective (how good your life is). How does one affect the other? What is quality of life? How does one define it?



Family Planning

During recent years, family planning has become an important part of population control. In addition to focusing on large trends in the growth of the population, environmental and social agencies propose that couples plan and space their children to slow down the rate of population growth.

Zero population growth is a situation in which the number of children born is no larger than the number of people who die during the same period of time. To attain zero population would require that each couple have two children, in other words, only “replace” themselves after their deaths. However, the present data show that approximately 150,000 people die every day in the world, while approximately 360,000 babies are born every day.





Predict Your School Population Using your school as a model, predict student population size in 50, 75, and 100 years. Make some assumptions about birth and death rates to reach your answer.





Abstinence is the safest and most certain choice for avoiding pregnancy. However, since most married couples do not want to abstain from sex, one practical way to avoid pregnancy is to use a method of contraception to prevent it. Some people may want to prevent pregnancy but may not have the means or knowledge to obtain contraceptives or use them correctly. This is especially true for young people. Some others are prohibited by their religious beliefs from using contraceptives. Ultimately, family planning is a matter of making choices within the constraints of one's life.





Why would parents who are older when they decide to have children help slow down the growth of populations? How would that work?





Debate! Should the government officially ask that couples limit family size to two children?





We have now discussed both the reasons for having children (and the consequences) and the reasons for not having children. Since we are particularly concerned about how these issues affect adolescents, let's explore how adolescents make these choices. How can you make your own choices and stick to them?





Activity 6-1: Reasons for Not Wanting Children


Introduction

Changing my lifestyle, more responsibilities, bills, wet diapers- “Oh, yuk! No way!” There could be any number of personal reasons why a person or a couple would not want to have children. Why would a person decide against parenthood? This is a good time to consider these reasons and take control of your decisions about parenthood.

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 On a separate piece of paper, write 5 reasons under each category:

a. Reasons for adolescents not to have children

b. Reasons for choosing to have children later, at a “planned” time.

c. Reasons people give for deciding to never have children.

Step 2 Upon completing your list, your teacher will divide the class into small groups. Take your list with you.

Step 3 Discuss the answers as a group.

Step 4 After the discussion, write your own position statement on this topic.

Abstinence

For most young people, planning a family is the last thing on their minds. They have more urgent things to think about-school, friends, parents, their bodies, clothes, and even the pimple on their nose. Having children seems so far in the future that they have trouble even imagining it.





Abstinence Persuade your class that abstinence is considered by many parents, teachers, and young people to be the only reasonable choice for adolescents. Agree or disagree.





Even though it seems like having children is far in the future to most adolescents, 3,000 American teenage girls got pregnant today, as many got pregnant yesterday, and another 3,000 will get pregnant tomorrow. Moreover, they did not get pregnant by themselves just thinking about it. Each of those girls who got pregnant engaged in sexual intercourse with a boy. Some of those girls may have said, “It won't happen to me.” But it did. It happened to them and to their sex partner.

The best and safest way to avoid pregnancy is to abstain or choose not to have sexual intercourse. A riskier choice is to reduce the chances of pregnancy by using contraceptives or birth control methods. However, it's important to understand that there is a chance that birth control methods will fail. With some methods the chances of failure are considerable. With others there is less chance of failure. But the fact is that those who do not abstain and do not use contraceptives can safely assume that sooner or later they will become pregnant or get someone else pregnant.

For some, these decisions will come easily. For others, they will be more difficult. Some will make a decision and stick to it. Others sometimes will and sometimes won't stick to their decisions. The least you can do is to learn about the available choices, and why and how to decide. What is at stake is nothing less than taking charge of a crucial part of your life.

In this section, we will discuss abstinence in more detail. In the next section, you will learn about specific contraceptive methods. Finally, in the last two sections we will return to the question of making choices and decisions.

Abstinence-What It Is and What It Is Not

The word abstain means to refrain from an activity by one's own choice. The activity can be anything. It does not have to be sex. In earlier times, the term referred to refraining from drinking alcoholic beverages. Now it is more commonly used to mean refraining from engaging in sexual intercourse.

Abstinence means choosing not to have intercourse for now. It does not mean giving up sex for life. That would be taking a vow of chastity.

Abstinence does not mean you cannot fall in love, express your emotions, share your secrets, be intimate, or plan your future together.

Abstinence does not mean you cannot be friends, have fun, or do things together.

Abstinence does not mean you are “frigid,” “impotent,” lacking a healthy sex drive, unattractive, not sexy, prudish, scared, cowardly, wimpy, old-fashioned, or not cool. Whether or not you decide to abstain has nothing to do with any of these things, and don't let anyone tell you, con you, sweet-talk you, or bully you into thinking otherwise.

Abstinence is a choice a person can make at any time. Even if someone has had sexual intercourse, that person can still choose abstinence. Abstinence is not “virginity.” It is not a line you cross over matter how sexually active a person has been, that person can still decide to abstain, from now on.

Abstinence is a commitment. To be meaningful, the decision to abstain must cover a significant period of time-this is not a decision that should be faced every Saturday night. That's a waste of time. You are making an important “policy” for yourself. It's a rule that should allow you to put the matter aside for a while and not fret about it.



The period of time to which you commit yourself should not be arbitrary. It would make little sense to decide to abstain for the next 10 minutes. Deciding about issues as important as this one is a serious decision, not a joke. To specify “one month” or “one year” makes little sense, also. Why not “two months”? Like all arbitrary rules, it is hard to follow. You may be tempted to link it to your sense of maturity- when you feel emotionally, psychologically, socially, and morally certain that you are ready. However, if you do this, you will be taking a greater chance of being wrong or confusing a strong desire to do something (and sex can be a very strong desire) with “being ready” for it. Instead, it helps to tie the time frame to a meaningful landmark that has some important connection to your ability to handle the consequences of your actions. For example, you may abstain until you graduate from high school, obtain a college degree, or get married. Setting the mark on an external event is safer since you are not likely to be confused about whether or not you have graduated from college or you are getting married.

Abstinence means no sexual intercourse. Abstinence does not mean no sexual arousal or expression and satisfaction of any kind. But you can figure out perfectly well that there are a hundred ways of interacting sexually without “doing it.” People touch, hug, kiss, caress, and so on. Not all such activities are necessarily safe or desirable, and there are other decisions to be made about whether or not to engage in them. But at least, they will not result in an unwanted pregnancy.



Reasons for Abstinence

Abstinence is the only foolproof way to avoid unwanted pregnancy.

Abstinence greatly reduces the chance of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Protection here is not as absolute since some STDs may be transmitted through other sexual activities as well. But intercourse is one of the main ways in which these diseases (including AIDS) are transmitted.

Abstinence helps you avoid getting hurt emotionally. When people engage in sexual intercourse, they cross a line in the level of intimacy. Sex complicates and confuses relationships if people are not ready for it. You want to be cared for because of who you are, not because of the sexual services or favors you render. Be friends first. To decide together not to have sex reflects your respect and commitment to each other.

Abstinence does not guarantee that others will respect your right to say no. However, it is less likely to put you in high-risk situations. Hence, it makes you less vulnerable. Being sexually available increases the chances of your being taken for granted and possibly being coerced into sex.

Abstinence follows the traditional moral principles held by many people in our society of avoiding sexual intercourse until marriage.

Abstinence not only protects you, but it also streamlines your life. You know your own rules and where you stand. This makes it easier to communicate to others. As a result, much of the uncertainty and guesswork goes out of your life. It saves you a lot of time and energy, which are better used on other worthwhile goals, including sex at the right time, with the right person, for the right reasons.

Abstinence eliminates risk.



Reasons Adolescents Give for Not Choosing Abstinence

The following are some reasons offered by teenagers for why some adolescents do not choose abstinence.

Some adolescents focus more on the physical pleasure of sexual intercourse, thus taking the risks listed above.

Abstinence often requires going against peer pressure.

Abstinence may result in losing a partner who demands sex. Sex becomes the price to pay for love, romance, friendship, or whatever it is that one values or fears to lose. One out of two females and one out of four males say they first engaged in sex because of affection for their partner.

Abstinence is seen as what parents are always pushing, and some teens don't want to do everything their parents tell them to do.

Sexual intercourse is seen as what grown-ups do, so some young people confuse having sex with being “adult.”



What Do You Think?

Why is communication an important part of practicing abstinence?





How to Abstain

The following steps will help you stick to your decision to choose abstinence.

Decide for yourself, in private, that you will not have sex for now and for a particular period of time.

Communicate your decision to someone you trust. This may be a close friend, a sibling, a trusted adult, or your parents.

If you have a friend or a potential sexual partner, or when you meet one, talk to him or her about your decision before you encounter situations in which sex would be possible or likely. Don't wait until you or your partner is sexually aroused or close to crossing the line. You need a cool head to give and hear the message. If you cherish and love the person, say so. If you feel sexually attracted to the person, say so. None of these feelings disqualify you from deciding on abstinence.

Make your partner a patty to the decision. Make a joint commitment. Then work out a plan to carry it out. Be clear about what is acceptable and what is not in your interactions. Don't improvise or compromise.

Ideally, your friend or partner will agree with you and support your decision, even if he or she would rather not choose abstinence. Your decision will have to be respected and, once the issue is settled, it has to stay settled. It is not up for review every five minutes.

Don't tolerate endless nagging, harassing, shaming, bullying, or any other tactic. (“If you love me, you will sleep with me” is a form of blackmail. Don't yield to it.) If push comes to shove, you may have to part company. Yes, it's tough, but there is no other way.

Activity 6-2: Who Decides?


Introduction

Most adolescents in the United States do not get pregnant. But there is a large group of teenagers who do get pregnant, and some become pregnant many times, which has an enormous impact on others, as well as on their own lives. The children they bring into the world face many hardships. Their behavior is also very costly to society.

What can, or should, society do about this situation? Role-play the decisions you would make to help solve this problem.

Step 2 Your teacher will divide the class into groups.

Step 3 Each group will prepare an oral argument favoring one of the following solutions:

Provide more sex education and contraceptive services.

Provide government money to improve the living conditions of adolescent parents.

Provide training in abstinence.

Contraception - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Contraception




What are the methods used and how do they work?

Abstinence is the safest choice, but some young men and women choose to engage in sex anyway. Should we simply let them take the risk and pay the price even when the price is so high? Or should we help them protect themselves? This unit is mean t for those who will need such protection against pregnancy. You may not be one of them. Yet, since most of us do ultimately engage in sex, the information may be useful for everyone at some time in his or her life.

In a sample of 13- to 18-year-olds, almost two out of three say the girls they know are very concerned about getting pregnant, as are two out of five boys. Yet this concern does not seem to help many young people protect themselves. Almost 60% of those who are sexually active say they are not using contraceptives every time they have sex. (Remember that all you need to do is skip contraception once to risk pregnancy.) Moreover, one third have not even talked to their sexual partner about preventing pregnancy, and one in five who has, has done so after having sex.

Preventive Behavior Sequence

People need two things to use contraception (methods of birth control) effectively. They need a reliable and safe contraceptive method, and they need a set of attitudes and behaviors that will allow them to make an effective “go of it.” One doesn't work without the other.

To minimize the chances of getting pregnant (remember, abstinence is the only sure method), the sexually active adolescent needs to take the following steps.

1. Accept your sexuality, which is your sense of yourself as a sexual being. The great Greek philosopher Socrates said, “Know thyself.” In all aspects of life, one must have a clear idea of who one is and what one wants. Recognizing that one is a sexual being with sexual feelings and needs is not always easy to see or accept. Since there is so much confusion and negative feeling about sexuality, it is tempting to deny that one is a sexual being. Often, adults (including parents) contribute to this denial of the adolescent's emerging sexuality because they may not know how to deal with it or may not want to deal with it, wishing that it would just go away. You can help your parents understand your conflicting emotions when you speak with them about your feelings and concerns. It is natural for parents to be concerned about this difficult time in their children's lives. Parents have many different ways of handling difficult situations. And although some parents may be too uncomfortable to discuss these topics with their children, many parents would welcome help in understanding the issues and changes their children are facing.

Ignorance or lack of acceptance of one's sexuality may lead to unplanned or unpredictable behavior. Some adolescents may engage in sex without being fully aware of what they are doing. It “just sort of happens” to them. Or they may refuse to learn about pregnancy or contraception because they are not “supposed” to be sexually active. Even some grown-ups fail to take contraceptive precautions because being “prepared” suggests that they are planning to have sex. It is as if they believe engaging in sexual intercourse spontaneously is more romantic or less immoral. These are some of the ways people kid themselves or save face with their partners. Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse, for whatever reasons, should at least know what they are doing.

2. Be informed about preventive behavior. First, learn how to assess the risk of pregnancy. As you may recall from earlier sections, a woman's risk of getting pregnant changes during the menstrual cycle. A man is always fertile, or able to reproduce. Second, be aware of the preventive options-when to abstain, how to stop short of intercourse; how to discuss pregnancy prevention with your partner, what contraceptive to use and how, how to help your partner make the right preventive decisions, and how to avoid or get out of high-risk situations.

3. Learn to make active, not passive, decisions about sex. People should not let their partner make all the decisions. It takes two to get pregnant. Therefore, both partners should share in the responsibility of making the decision. Contraception and pregnancy are not only a woman's problem. Anyone should be able to talk openly about preventing pregnancy with a sexual partner. If, for whatever reason, the partners can't do that, one or both of them are not ready to engage in sex. Furthermore, this discussion should take place ahead of time-not when they are just about ready to engage in sex. Effective contraception requires planning.

4. Preventing pregnancy requires planning and certain public activities, such as purchasing condoms or obtaining a prescription for birth control pills. These public activities can seem embarrassing. By engaging in these acts, someone knows that sex is planned. However, embarrassment should not keep people from protecting themselves.

5. Be consistent. To avoid pregnancy, one must use contraceptives correctly each and every time one engages in sex. All it takes is one weak link for the chain to break. For example, if a man is using condoms, it may only take one time when he doesn't have one or doesn't feel like using one to get his partner pregnant. Ultimately, all the knowledge, all the discussions, and all the contraceptives people have are of no use unless they use them effectively each and every time they engage in sex.

6. Be flexible. Different couples at different times in their relationship may rely on different methods to prevent pregnancy. It is important to rely on whatever works best under the circumstances. An approach that worked in the past may not work as well in the future. When a person's life circumstances change or he or she has a new sexual partner, the issue of pregnancy prevention has to be reconsidered and renegotiated. And remember that people who have been engaging in sexual intercourse and using contraceptives can still switch to abstinence.

Barriers to Effective Birth Control

There are many external, or social, as well as internal, or psychological, barriers that may make it difficult for a young person to take the preventive measures described above.

Among external barriers are social attitudes that make it hard for young people to learn about pregnancy prevention or to have access to contraceptives. Some people think that to allow young people such freedom encourages them to have premarital sex. However, sexual knowledge and sexual behavior are two very different things. So gaining information about topics as important as reproduction and contraception can help people make informed decisions.

Young people who abstain from sexual intercourse are absolutely safe from pregnancy. Those who engage in it fully informed, knowledgeable about methods of prevention, and prepared are at risk, but are safer than people who use no prevention. Those who engage in sex with no protection or who use protection inconsistently run the highest risk of pregnancy and disease.

Often, younger adolescents have trouble linking an action with its consequences. They know sex leads to pregnancy. But they often take refuge in false beliefs or are misled by inaccurate information. For example, only half of adolescents questioned know when the fertile period is during the menstrual cycle. Some think of the time of ovulation as the “safe period.” Some think they are “too young” to get pregnant. Others believe if they do not reach orgasm, they will be safe. Still others believe that if you have sex standing up, you won't get pregnant; or if you urinate right after sex, you will be safe. These are just some of the misconceptions believed by many adolescents. Adolescents owe it to themselves to conduct the research and ask questions about topics as important as these, if they are basing their actions on these beliefs.





Mixed Messages Spend one week evaluating messages about sex that you come across in songs, movies, on TV, in magazines, etc. Chart the messages under the following categories:

Discourages sexual behavior

Encourages sexual behavior

Mentions contraception

Mentions consequences of sexual activity.



Draw some conclusions about the messages you receive, and sh are them with the class.





Other obstacles arise from exaggerated or false fears about contraceptives, such as birth control pills will cause cancer, or contraceptive devices are messy or lessen sexual sensations, and so on. Learning the true and accurate information about sex and sexual reproduction is the best way to contradict these misconceptions.

The portrayal of sexual relations in movies, on TV, in magazines, and through exposures to other media further confuse young people. Although constantly exposed to sexual themes, young people rarely see any hint that people try to prevent pregnancy in any way. This helps to create a world of sexual behavior that is far from the real world in which we live.

Obviously, preventing pregnancy requires a commitment to not getting pregnant. It also requires good decision-making skills and a thorough and accurate knowledge of the choices available such as abstinence.

Contraceptives are devices used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control, which is at the core of family planning, is a somewhat broader term that refers to avoiding pregnancy and deciding when to have children.





What is the difference between an unplanned and an unwanted pregnancy?





Did You Know?

The word contraception comes from contra -against-and ception -act of becoming pregnant. It refers to various methods of avoiding pregnancy.



People use birth control to engage in sexual intercourse with less risk of pregnancy. Before learning about the specifics of each kind of contraceptive, consider the following facts.

For those who do not choose abstinence, contraception can work to avoid pregnancy only if a safe, effective method is used each time, every time, with no ifs, ands, or buts. A physician, parent, or health worker can help with information about contraceptives and decision making.

Since no birth control method except abstinence is foolproof, using more than one method decreases risk. For example, condoms add extra protection in combination with any other birth control method.

While it is better to use something than nothing, some methods are better than others. Hormonal methods such as the birth control pill give better protection than condoms. Condoms with spermicide give better protection than condoms alone. Withdrawal is better than unprotected sex. The most important approach is to use common sense, think, and plan.

Like most things in life, having sex involves cost and risk. Anyone who decides to engage in sex must be prepared to accept the consequences of his or her decisions and actions.

Birth control methods vary in their degree of effectiveness and in the side effects, the negative consequences, resulting from their use. So both effectiveness and side effects must be considered when making decisions that are this important. This is an area in which a physician, other health-care professionals, and/or a responsible and trusted adult can help you discover the most accurate information about contraceptives.



Did You Know?

Contraception has been practiced throughout human history. In fact, the ideas used long ago are the same as the ideas used today; only the materials have changed.

Spermicides used long ago (ancient Egyptians):

wine, garlic, and fennel

crocodile dung, sodium bicarbonate, and honey



Barrier methods:

pastes made from absorbent plants, especially roots and herbs (ancient Greeks and Romans)

clay (Native Americans)

paper (Japanese)

balls of silk (French)



Other methods used

magic

superstitions about clothing, jewelry, washing





Methods of Birth Control

Birth control involves more than knowledge about contraception. Birth control is part of a sexual relationship. It involves making good choices, following effective decision-making processes, and dealing rationally with psychological and moral concerns.

Throughout recorded history, people have been using one form or another of birth control. Probably the oldest and most commonly used method has been withdrawal. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation, which is the release of sperm during orgasm. Ancient methods, such as withdrawal, did not and still do not work very well. However, they were better than nothing at all. Today's contraceptives have much higher rates of effectiveness.

Currently, about half of the world population has access to good contraceptive methods. The best methods are both effective and safe. Usually, the more developed the country, the more likely it is that couples can get and will use contraceptives, and that the population will grow more slowly.





What is the difference between contraception and abortion?





Activity 7-1: What Will They Choose?


Introduction

It is difficult to make an important decision under the best of circumstances, when you have time to think things through, time to consider the consequences, input from reliable and unbiased sources, and no pressures on you to decide. It becomes much more difficult to make or stick to a decision when emotion, desire, or outside pressures are present. Imagine that the person you have dreamed about is holding your hand, the setting is perfect, and you are alone. Things are moving quickly. Will you be able to make the right decision in this type of romantic situation? Will your ability to think clearly be swayed by emotion?

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 Your teacher will give you an Activity Report to read.

Step 2 This sheet contains two scenarios in which couples are about to make sexual decisions. Read the scenarios carefully so that you can answer several questions.

Step 3 Your teacher will then divide the class into small groups for discussion.

Step 4 The groups will report their conclusions to the class.

What Do You Think?

How does the phrase “Know thyself” relate to avoiding pregnancy?



Preventing Ovulation

Without an egg (or sperm), pregnancy cannot occur. Birth control pills prevent the ovaries from producing mature eggs. The pill is a form of oral contraception (birth control taken by mouth). There are different types of pills, but they all consist of the hormones (chemical substances) estrogen and progesterone used singly or together in various combinations.





How many pills are there in the box? Why not less or more?





Figure 7.1 Birth control pills.

The hormones in the Pill prevent ovulation, or the release of an egg from the ovary. Progestin also makes a mucous plug at the cervix and changes the lining of the uterus so that a fertilized egg cannot implant itself. The Pill therefore works in a variety of ways to prevent pregnancy.

Did You Know?

The Pill became available in the 1960s and is based on the 1930s finding that progesterone could prevent ovulation. In the United States, 10.7 million women use the Pill as a method of contraception. Of the 5 million sexually active teens, 1.7 million, or 34% use the Pill.





These actions make the Pill one of the most effective contraceptive methods available. Under ideal conditions, no more than 1 in 1,000, or 0.1%, of users become pregnant during a given year. However, the actual or typical failure rate, including the factor of human error, is 6%. This means that if 100 sexually active women use the Pill for one year, an average of 6 out of 1,000 will become pregnant. Human error (forgetting to take the Pill) accounts mainly for the difference between the typical (actual) failure rate and the ideal failure rate, when the method is used absolutely correctly and consistently.

As with most chemicals and drugs, the Pill has some side effects. Side effects are unpleasant or harmful reactions to a drug other than the intended effect (in this case, contraception). The minor side effects of the Pill include temporary and mild nausea, weight gain, breast tenderness, and skin discoloration. These side effects mimic symptoms of early pregnancy, a time when the body also has high levels of estrogen. Not all Pill users experience these side effects.

Did You Know?

One-third of women in the United States using contraception use the Pill.



Although serious risks or side effects of the Pill are rare, its use can lead to an increased chance of heart attack, stroke, hypertension (high blood pressure), and blood clots. Smokers and women 35 or older risk these complications more than other users. The Pill may also increase the chance of breast cancer for some women. The Pill can be expensive over long periods of time and places all the responsibility for contraception on the woman. It requires a prescription and therefore may be, for some people, more difficult to get.

These possible side effects of the Pill should be considered by anyone thinking about using them. However, the Pill is considered to be a reasonably safe and highly effective form of contraception, if taken correctly and consistently.

Bear in mind that pregnancy itself is not free of risk. It has its own “side effects,” as well as the potential of more serious complications, including death. On balance, the health risks of pregnancy are higher than the health risks of using the Pill. The Pill has much lower levels of hormone in it than it did 20 years ago. It was the high levels of hormone that were riskier.





Persuade the Class! Should prescription contraceptives be available without parental consent for people under age 18? Why or why not?





The Pill is the main, but not the only, form of hormonal contraception. The most recently approved and available form is not a pill, but an implant. A doctor implants several thin matchstick-like rods containing progestin under the patient's skin. The implant is called Norplant. The implanted rods can stay for up to five years and provide 99% protection from pregnancy. Statistics show that if 100 women use Norplant for one year, only one will become pregnant. If the woman wants to become pregnant, the implants are removed. Fertility returns in a couple of months. Norplant is currently the most effective contraceptive (except for sterilization, which is discussed later). It eliminates human errors such as forgetting to take the Pill.

Is there a pill for males? It is possible to depress the production of sperm through hormonal methods. However, since men produce billions of sperm, it is harder to completely shut off their production. Over time, a pill may also interfere with a man's ability to have an erection. It is possible that someday an effective male hormonal contraceptive will be available.

Natural Methods

If we could stop sperm from reaching an egg, no one would get pregnant. Ovulation occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle (about day 14) and the ovum survives for about a day in the Fallopian tube (see Section 3). So why not avoid intercourse for a day or two at the time of ovulation and prevent pregnancy in this natural way? This method, known as the rhythm method, costs nothing and has no harmful side effects.

This sounds great, but unfortunately there is one hitch. It is difficult to know exactly when ovulation takes place. This is why the method is not very effective. Its failure rate is about 20%. That means that 20 out of 100, or lout of 5 women, (over the course of a year) who rely only on the rhythm method will become pregnant. Ovulation does not always occur on day 14, and it is not easy to detect exactly when it does take place, even with techniques such as ovulation test kits. If doctors find accurate ways that easily detect when ovulation is about to occur, the rhythm method may well become the best form of birth control. That day may come, but it is not here yet.

Meanwhile, a lot of young women get pregnant because they think they know when it is “safe” to have sex. Some people think the middle of the cycle (when they ovulate) is the safe period. However, the middle of the cycle is actually the least safe period. Some girls think that during or just after menstruation is a safe time, but that is not always true. A woman should not think of various times in menstrual cycles as “safe” or “unsafe,” but as “lower risk” and “higher risk.” The lower- and higher-risk times are indicated in Figure 7.2, which shows a 28-day cycle. (Note that not everyone has 28-day cycles. There may be 36 days between two menstrual periods. The length of the cycle may change. But there is almost always 14 days between ovulation and the next menstruation.)



Figure 7.2 Risks of pregnancy during menstrual cycle. The rhythm method works only if you know exactly when ovulation occurs (not when it is supposed to occur). One cannot count on the lower-risk times as being completely risk free.





Not everyone has 28-day cycles. There may be 36 days between two menstrual periods. The length of the cycle may change. But there is almost always 14 days between ovulation and the next menstruation. It's the first part of the menstrual cycle (days 1-14) that varies. If a woman has a 36-day cycle, on what day would she be likely to ovulate? If a woman has a 21-day cycle, on what day would she be likely to ovulate?





The other natural contraceptive method is withdrawal of the penis before ejaculation. Again, this method is not very reliable. As with the rhythm method, withdrawal has a failure rate of about 20%. During sexual arousal, men cannot be safely relied upon to withdraw (which means stopping intercourse). Also, it is possible for some sperm to escape before ejaculation. Therefore, it is essential that the penis avoid all contact with the vagina before contraceptive devices are in place.

Barrier Methods

Stopping sperm and ova from contacting each other can be more effectively done by barrier methods, which prevent pregnancy by blocking the union of sperm and egg. The most commonly used barrier is the condom, which is a sheath, often made of latex, that covers the penis and collects the sperm.

The condom is placed on the penis before the penis comes into contact with the vagina. The condom has other benefits as well. For example, condoms guard against some sexually transmitted diseases. However, only latex condoms protect against viral infections such as HIV, or AIDS. Also, condoms are inexpensive, don't require a prescription, require the male partner to take responsibility, and have essentially no health risks or side effects. However, condoms can break; they need to be put on correctly during sexual arousal, and new users may find them difficult to put on at first. In addition, condoms can interrupt the process of sexual intercourse. Used alone without spermicides, condoms have a 2% ideal failure rate, and a 16% typical failure rate.



Figure 7.3 Condoms.

Spermicides contain chemicals that kill sperm. Rather than working as a mechanical barrier like the condom, spermicides provide a chemical barrier. In other words, pregnancy is prevented through chemical action. Unfortunately, spermicides used alone are not very effective. Using spermicides alone, 30% of women will get pregnant in a year's time. However, when used with a barrier method, such as a condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap, spermicides work more effectively. When used with a spermicide, condoms can be very reliable. The lowest observed failure rate is 2%. However, a typical (average) use still results in a 12% failure rate.





Debate! Should condoms be available in high schools?





Spermicides come in different forms, and they are usually put directly in the vagina in the form of tablets, foams, jellies, or creams. All work within some time constraints-some last longer than others. Some need to be inserted at least 10 minutes before intercourse. All need to be used each time sex occurs, no matter how soon a person might have sex again. Spermicides come with detailed instructions that help the user identify the most effective way to use the spermicide.





For the following two contraceptive methods, give an example of how the contraceptive method might be used in correctly, thus contributing to the “typical” failure rate.

condoms

spermicides





Some people find spermicides messy, hard to use, or irritating to the skin. But spermicides may protect against some sexually transmitted diseases as well as against unwanted pregnancies. And like the condom, spermicides have essentially no harmful side effects. This barrier method is inexpensive and available without a prescription.

The diaphragm is an example of another barrier method. The diaphragm is a thin latex dome prescribed and fitted by a physician. Prior to sex, it is filled with spermicidal jelly and then inserted into the vagina to block the cervix (and the uterus). The diaphragm has an ideal failure rate of 6%, and a typical failure rate of 18%.



Figure 7.4 Diaphragm.

The diaphragm also relies on spermicide for it to function effectively. It may be inserted up to six hours in advance. However, any additional acts of intercourse require more spermicide, which can be added without removing the diaphragm. There are few negative side effects, except for occasional reactions to the spermicides.





What are three benefits to using a condom? What are three drawbacks to using a condom? What are two benefits to using a spermicide? What are two drawbacks?





Figure 7.5 Cervical cap.

The cervical cap is nearly identical to the diaphragm except that it is smaller and fits more snugly against the cervix, remaining there through suction. Used with spermicide, it is as effective as the diaphragm, with a 6% ideal rate of failure and an 18% typical failure rate. It can be left in place twice as long as the diaphragm, or up to 48 hours.

Finally, the most certain and permanent way of stopping sperm and egg from reaching each other is sterilization. In the male, a physician performs a simple operation to tie off the vas deferens (vasectomy). Though the testes continue to produce sperm, none will get through to the penis (sperm get reabsorbed into the body). In women, the operation involves tying off the Fallopian tubes, so that the egg and sperm can't meet. Sterilization does not affect production of hormones by the testes and ovaries, nor does it affect sexual function.

Did You Know?

The diaphragm, cervical cap, and condom were invented in the mid 1800s after the invention of mass produced rubber. All have been in use since then.



Sterilization is now the most common method of birth control in the United States. Sterilization accounts for about one-third of all birth control methods. In women, 30% have their Fallopian tubes tied surgically. In men, 13% have vasectomies. However, both procedures are often irreversible. Although surgical procedure can try to repair the tubes, they work only in 60% of cases. Such procedures involve complicated operations. Sterilization is appropriate for people who are quite sure they do not want to have any more children.

Interrupting Pregnancy - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Interrupting Pregnancy




When does contraception become abortion?

All the methods considered so far prevent the fertilization of the egg by the sperm, hence avoiding conception. These are clearly methods of contraception.

Other contraceptive devices work after the egg has become fertilized but before or shortly after implantation in the uterus. These devices do not prevent fertilization but stop the development of the fertilized egg. Some allow fertilization to occur but prevent the fertilized egg from implanting itself in the uterus or expel it shortly after. These types of devices or methods can be considered agents that interrupt rather than prevent pregnancy. Some experts associate pregnancy with implantation of the embryo in the uterus, By this definition, all methods that act prior to implantation are considered contraceptives. Methods that dislodge the implanted embryo constitute forms of abortion.

Did You Know?

The IUD was developed in the 1930s but only became available in the 1960s. With 50 million users worldwide, it is second to the Pill in women's choice of contraceptives. But in the United States, it is used by less than 5 percent of women.



The IUD, or intrauterine device, is a small object about the size of a small paper clip that a physician inserts in the uterus. Many types of IUDs have been used in the past, but because certain designs can cause infection, only one model is available in the United States.

This model is a plastic “T-shape” with a nylon thread or tail attached to the bottom of it. This “tail” trails out of the cervix to the vagina, allowing a woman to check that the IUD is still in place.



Figure 8.1 Intrauterine device .

What Do You Think?

Some people argue that these devices are not contraceptives (which prevent fertilization) but are more like agents that cause abortion or interrupt the progress of the pregnancy. What is your opinion?



An IUD releases the hormone progesterone. This is the same hormone contained in the Pill. Even without the progesterone, the IUD works as a contraceptive device, though exactly how is still unclear. Through irritation of the uterine wall, the IUD may change the uterine lining like the progesterone does, thus preventing implantation. Or if implantation occurs, the IUD may dislodge the fertilized egg from the wall of the uterus.

The two most common negative side effects of the IUD are irregular menstrual periods and pelvic pain. Menstrual periods tend to be heavier when a woman has an IUD in her uterus. In addition, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) tends to be more common for women who use the IUD. PID is a serious infection of the reproductive tract often leading to infertility. For this reason, many single women who have never had children do not use this method. Therefore, this is not typically a method used by young people.

Unlike the Pill or barrier methods that depend on the user for the method to be effective, the IUD's success depends on the proper placement by a health-care professional. The IUD has an ideal failure rate of 0.8%, and a typical failure rate of 4%.

Another way of preventing implantation is to take hormones or chemicals after sexual intercourse. Such chemicals are often called the “morning after” pill. A fairly new drug called RU 486 interrupts pregnancy in most cases if it is taken within 10 days of a missed period and then is followed by an injection of progesterone. Some people consider a chemical or drug such as RU 486 an agent that causes abortion rather than a contraceptive device.

Abortion

Some pregnancies result in a miscarriage. A miscarriage is the natural elimination of a fetus before it is viable. Miscarriages often occur between the 12th and 28th weeks of a pregnancy. Miscarriages can result from a variety of causes such as a defective embryo. Although a miscarriage is a type of natural abort ion, the term abortion usually refers to the intentional interruption (termination) of a pregnancy. There are many different reasons given for aborting an embryo or fetus. In some cases, an abort ion may be necessary to save the pregnant woman's life. In other cases, the pregnancy may have resulted from rape. Tests may show that the fetus has a serious defect. Or the pregnant woman may decide she does not want to have a child at this time.

Medically speaking, an abortion performed by a physician early in the pregnancy is a safe and quick procedure. In most abortions, either the embryo is taken out of the uterus by a suction tube, or the mother is given an injection that causes the uterus to expel the embryo or fetus from the body. The chances of a pregnant woman dying from abortion in the first trimester, which is when most abortions occur, are less than her dying as a result of complications of pregnancy carried to full term. Abortions were illegal before 1973. At that time some women tried to perform their own abortions or sought an abortion from untrained abortionists. Before the legalization of abortions, 1 in 3,000 women died each year in the United States because of botched illegal abortions. Now only 1 in 167,000 die as a result of legal abortions.

For some women, abortion brings up complex psychological problems such as feelings of regret, sadness, or grief. Other women experience relief and do not seem to suffer serious or long-term emotional problems.





Debate Should the government pay for abortions for mothers on welfare who have no insurance?





Currently, abortions are legal everywhere in the United States during the first trimester and with some possible restrictions in the second trimester. However, each state has its own laws about who pays for the abortion (the person or the government). The issue of abortion becomes even more controversial when mothers on welfare seek an abortion but can't pay for it themselves. About 1 million women have abortions each year in the United States. (About 50 million abortions per year are reported worldwide.)





Debate The following are two statements about abortion. Discuss each statement. Then debate the issue of abortion.

If you can't trust a woman with a choice, how can you trust her with a child?

Babies should have a choice abortion is murder.





In the United States, a quarter of all pregnancies and about half of all unintended pregnancies end with an abortion. The majority of abortions are performed on women younger than 25 years, many of them teenagers. About 8 in 10 abortions involve unmarried women.

Any discussion of abortion raises legal, religious, ethical, and moral issues. Feelings about abortion differ from country to country and within different cultures. For example, abortion is illegal in some countries, but legal in others. The most serious difference of opinion about abortion in the United States involves the moral and legal aspects of abortion, Public opinion is divided over this issue, and many people feel very strongly about it.

Those who are opposed to abortion are usually said to be pro-life. They consider abortion a form of infanticide, similar to the killing of children. Some people would like to see all abortions made illegal. Others feel exceptions should be made in special cases such as to save the mother's life or for a rape victim who becomes pregnant. Still others feel abortion should be allowed, but only up to a certain point in a pregnancy, such as within the first trimester.

Those in favor of keeping abortion an option for all women are usually said to be pro-choice. Pro-choice advocates believe that women should be able to decide for themselves and obtain legal abortions in safe environments.

People on both sides of this debate have compelling arguments that are based on deeply held beliefs and values. As with many issues in a democracy, everyone is entitled to express his or her views on this matter.

What Do You Think?

Would you vote for or against a candidate for the Senate based only on his or her position on abortion? How might voting in this manner affect our system of government?



The majority of abort ions are performed to end pregnancies that are the result of a contraceptive failure on the part of a couple. Typically, this means failure to abstain from sex, failure to take the necessary contraceptive precautions, or failure to think clearly before embarking on the path to parenthood. There are, of course, exceptions. In some cases, a woman may become pregnant because of the failure of the contraceptive device over which she has no control. Remember, no contraceptive method is foolproof. Other women are made pregnant against their will as a result of rap e. There are cases in which pregnancy threatens the woman's health or even life, or the fetus shows a serious abnormality.





Activity 8-1: What Are the Issues?


Introduction

Consider these scenarios:

A woman is raped and later discovers that she is pregnant.

A pregnant woman feels she is not yet prepared to give birth and raise a child.

The pregnant daughter of an abusive parent was told that she would be beaten “within an inch of your life” if she-ever got pregnant.

A doctor warns a pregnant mother that giving birth again could be fatal to her.

A pregnant woman is told by her boyfriend that she must get an abortion or he will leave her.



What should these individuals do? Is abortion ever justified? Who decides?

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 Write your thoughts on this topic: “Is it ever okay to have an abortion? Explain why or why not.” These are your private thoughts. Do not worry about grammar or spelling or even about writing your name on the paper. Give this question some serious thought and write about 50 words. Just writing “Yes” or “No” or “Because” is not answering the question.

Step 2 Now, take your written response to the question and put it away. You will refer to this paper at the end of the activity.

Step 3 Read the introduction again. Each of the sentences involving a pregnant woman is called a scenario. Think of at least one more realistic scenario involving a pregnant woman. Write this scenario down and give it to your teacher when it is requested.

Step 4 Your teacher will now give instructions for a class discussion on the issue of abortion.





Write a letter to someone who is contemplating an abortion. In your letter, discuss your personal views about abortion.

Making Decisions - Student Edition (Human Biology)





Making Decisions




How do you make good decisions?

You are entering an exciting time of life. Many new opportunities and situations will be presented to you. With these new opportunities come more decisions, not just about what clothes to buy, but more difficult and emotionally challenging decisions that can impact your life for years to come. Will you go to college or get a job, or maybe both? Will you spend the evening at your girlfriend's/boyfriend's ho use while her or his parents are gone? Will you tell someone about your friend's drinking problem? At some point in your life, you may be faced with a seemingly impossible decision, for which no option seems viable. Some health-care issues, such as abortion or drug use, involve deep emotional issues that are difficult to resolve.

For any kind of decision, it helps to have a systematic way of sorting out the possibilities and thinking about the consequences so that you can better anticipate the results. Everyone makes bad decisions occasionally, which not only teach you about yourself, but also motivate you to think more carefully the next time.

While there are a number of different ways to make decisions, good decisions can be made using these guidelines.

Use some objective system of taking apart a decision to identify all the parts and evaluate their importance. You may even have to make a decision that, although difficult, allows you to take control of your life.

Take responsibility for your own decision. Of course, you have many friends and family members who support you. However, knowing that you alone must accept the results of your decision helps you focus on the important elements of the decision.

Make an effort to think thoroughly and creatively in order to explore as many options and outcomes as possible.

Analyze both good and bad decisions you and others have made. Then learn from them. This will help you develop your self-confidence about making good decisions.





Hindsight Has Perfect Vision Think of a situation in which you made a bad decision. Write down the scenario, including how you made the decision. At what point did you go wrong? What did you learn from this decision?





The Decision Process

Suppose you need to make an important decision. You can think of any important decision you might be confronted with at this time. Or you can use the following hypothetical situation to practice the decision making process.

Suppose your boyfriend/girlfriend wants you to come over Friday evening while his/her parents are out. You and he/ she have been dating for a few months, and you feel some pressure to let the relationship become more physical. You know you're not ready for sexual intercourse, but you and he/ she haven't really talked about your relationship. You also know he/ she is not inviting you over to bake cookies. Should you go? Should you suggest something else? Should you talk to him/her? Should you invite other friends to come over too? Try making a decision about this hypothetical situation by following this six-step decision-making process:

1. What are your goals?

Write down your thoughts and goals. In the case described, the goals might include further developing your relationship with your boyfriend or girlfriend, maintaining your self-esteem, and having fun. As you make more and more decisions, you may notice a pattern of goals-goals that reflect your underlying values at the time. Goals can be abstract such as having fun or developing a relationship, or they may be concrete such as baking cookies, kissing, or getting an A on tomorrow's science test. Whether they are abstract or concrete, they can change over time.

2. What options do you have?

Consider all of your alternative options and write them down. Be creative and thorough. Identifying all the alternatives is difficult, but again, with experience you'll get the hang of it. Think of these options on a spectrum-a line. At each end of the line, list the extreme options. In the case described, one end of the line would be “Going to his/her house.” The other end of the spectrum would be “Not seeing him/her at all on Friday.” Now it's a little easier to think of other options that fall somewhere in between, such as going out instead, talking with each other about each of your expectations for the evening, or inviting other friends over too.

3. Where would each option lead?

Consider each option and think of all the possible outcomes for each one. Identifying your options and recognizing their possible outcomes are the most important elements of any decision-making process. From buying shoes to choosing a mate, slowing down and thinking about the choices available to you in a systematic way helps bring out many issues you might not have thought of otherwise. And it is a skill you will use throughout your life. In the situation described, your outcomes might include developing your relationship, exploring your physical relationship, having fun, getting in trouble if any parents find out, damaging what people think of you, or developing self-esteem. What are some other outcomes you can think of?

Now, construct a chart of your options and the possible outcomes. Keeping in mind the goals you have set for yourself. Evaluate the outcomes for each option with a plus or a minus. Add up the pluses and minuses in each option column. Which option gives you the highest score?

You don't have to assign values to each option. You may find that it is enough just to write down and analyze the alternatives and outcomes. The numbers provide an objective evaluation of the options.

Looking at the result may surprise you, and you might wish it had come out a different way. This process helps you identify what is important to you, what your goals really are. You can weight the pluses and minuses to reflect the importance of certain outcomes. Since self-esteem, having fun, and developing your relationship are really important to you, multiply those pluses or minuses by 3. Now count up the pluses and minuses.

Total pluses +2 +3

4. How do the results compare with each other?

If you have a tie, you have several choices. You can weight each option with additional pluses or minuses (Figure 9.2) depending on how important that issue is to you, or you can add another option that lies somewhere between the two extremes.





Sources of Advice Who in your life would be a good source of advice about big issues in your life (friends, school, sex, money, future, and so on)? If you can, think of five possible sources of advice and write them down. Share with the class what categories these sources would fall into, for example, friend, parent, relative, other adult, teacher, counselor, or clergy.

5. Which choice will you make?

Sometimes making a chart like the ones in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 clarifies your options and helps you predict different outcomes in a decision. In the case described, however, you could tip the scales in either direction. You may need to think some more about your values and how they relate to sexual intimacy, friendship, and self-esteem. You may want to get other people's opinions.

What Do You Think?

Can you think of several situations in which your intuition is a better judge of what to do than a decision process?



Despite this very rational decision-making process, you still may not feel right about the outcome. Not feeling right about the outcome can tell you something about the goals you have set for yourself. For example, you may have come up with a score that supports going to your friend's house, but, in your gut, you just don't want to. That's okay. The process did its job. It helped you realize what is right for you.

6. Following through with your decision

When you make a decision, it helps to develop a plan of action so you can stick to your decision. It's often very difficult to stick to your decision when there are many pressures or surprises. One way to help you with these kinds of pressures is to be clear and strong in the way you express yourself to others. Communication strategies will not automatically solve your problems or make the situation easy, but they will announce to others what your decision is and demonstrate the importance of your commitment to your decision.

Another way of following through with your decision is to deal with stressful elements in your life. There are lots of ways to reduce stress or anxiety such as talking with a friend, spending time away from the problem, or just putting yourself in environments that make you feel competent, strong, and good about yourself. Sometimes the most stress comes when you're thinking about acting on your decision. At other times, stress comes after the fact, when you're dealing with people's reactions. Either way, it's important to recognize your stress and build a less stressful environment.

Obstacles

Sometimes, making good decisions isn't easy. Sometimes it seems like everyone is against you, and no matter what the choice is, you'll lose. What are some of the common obstacles for even the most rational decision maker?

Parents/Adults

Sometimes the older people in your life have a difficult time “shifting gears.” They are used to your comfortable and reassuring dependence and cooperation. Now you may be at a point in your life when you'd like to make some of your own decisions and choices. For both you and the adults in your life, it may be best to work through the process together the first few times. If your parents or other adults see how rational and competent you are, they will encourage your independence and congratulate themselves on a job well done. You may even benefit from the suggestions of these experienced decision makers. You may even find a way to get an objective discussion going with a parent or teacher, instead of the emotional or argumentative one you may have expected. Joint decision making often works out well.

Evaluating advice

Who is a source of advice? How much should you believe? Sometimes it helps to talk over a difficult decision with an adult or friend you trust. He or she may come up with ideas you haven't considered. Seeking advice from an objective source-someone who is not involved-is better than seeking advice from someone who may be affected by your decision. Learning who has vested interests, something to gain or lose from your actions, will help you evaluate how objective that person will be.

Yourself

Making a choice involves some degree of confidence. Trusting your own judgment comes with time and practice. It's easy to avoid a decision. You are at a stage of life when avoidance may tell you you're not ready yet for the activity, such as the intimacy of a sexual relationship, or that you don't know how to make the decision. Practicing a decision- making process for even the simplest decisions will help you gain confidence, know yourself, and be ready to make good decisions in important situations.

What Do You Think?

How might you handle a situation in which you reached a decision, after a careful thought process, but it went against the advice given to you by someone you trusted?



Peer pressure

Going against the flow is tough and takes a lot of self-confidence. You have to like yourself and want the best for yourself to make some of the tough decisions that may come around. From smoking to clothes to attitudes, you have to do what is in your best interest and trust that people will like you all the better if you stick up for yourself without being rude or insulting them for not doing the same.





Activity 9-1: Effective Decision Making


Introduction

Decisions, decisions! Every day you are faced with making decisions. Some decisions may not be life altering.

“Should I get out of bed today?”

“What color socks should I wear?”



Other decisions can change your life.

“Should I drop out of school?”

“Should I try drugs just this once?”

“Should I be sexually active?”



Do you have a plan of action to use when you are faced with a serious decision that must be made?

Materials

Activity Report



Procedure

Step 1 Your teacher will divide the class into groups.

Step 2 Each group will choose a problem that someone has had recently.

Step 3 Using the six-step process for effective decision making, apply these steps to your selected problem. Write out a full description of a way this problem can be solved.

Step 4 Your group will be asked to share its recommended solution with the class for discussion.





Describe a situation in which a teenager may have to make a high-risk choice (sex . . . drugs . . . drinking . . .) under peer pressure. Then go through the decision-making steps and write your suggested solution.
